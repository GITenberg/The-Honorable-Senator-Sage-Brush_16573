<h3>BECAUSE PATRICIA SAID "NO"</h3>


<p>Some one was giving a dinner dance at the country
club, and Blount, who was a week-end guest of
the Beverleys, was ill-natured enough to be resentful.
What right had a gay and frivolous world to
come and thrust its light-hearted happiness upon
him when Patricia had said "No"? It was like
bullying a cripple, he told himself morosely, an<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>d
when he had read the single telegram which had
come while he was at dinner he begged Mrs. Beverley's
indulgence and went out to find a chair in a
corner of the veranda where the frivolities had not
as yet intruded.</p>

<p>It was a North Shore night like that in which
Shakespeare has mingled moon-shadows with the
gossamer fantasies of the immortal "Dream."
Though the dance was in-doors, the trees on the
lawn and the road-fronting verandas of the club-house
were hung with festoons of Chinese lanterns.
At the carriage-entrance smart automobiles were
coming and going, and one of them, with the dust
of the Boston parkways on its running-gear, brought
the guests of honor&#8212;three daughters of a Western
senator lately home from their summer abroad.</p>

<p>Blount knew neither the honorers nor the honored
ones, and had resolutely refused the chance
offered him by Mrs. Beverley to amend his ignorance.
For Patricia's "No" was not yet twenty-four
hours old, and since it had changed the stars
in their courses for Patricia's lover, the cataclysm
was much too recent to postulate anything like a
return of the heavenly bodies to their normal orbits.</p>

<p>Not that Blount put it th<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>at way, either to Mrs.
Beverley or to himself. He was a level-eyed, square-shouldered
young man of an up-to-date world, and
the stock from which he sprang was prosaic and
practical rather than poetic or sentimental. But
the fact remained, and when he sat back in his
corner absently folding the lately received telegram
into a narrow spill and scowling moodily down upon
the coming and going procession of motor-cars he
was unconsciously giving a very life-like imitation
of the disappointed lover the world over.</p>

<p>It was thus, and apparently by the merest chance,
that Gantry found him; a chance because the Winnebasset
club-house is spacious and the dinner dance
minimized the hazards of a meeting between two
unattached men who were merely transient guests.
But the railroad man at least was unfeignedly glad.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it beat the dickens what a little world
this is?" he exclaimed, with a true bromidian disregard
for the outworn and the axiomatic. "Of
course, I knew you were in or around Boston somewhere,
but to run slap up against you here, when
there seemed to be nothing in it for me but to be
bored stiff&#8212;" He stopped short, finding it difficult
to be shiftily insincere with as old a friend as Evan
Blount. But in the nature of things it was baldly
impossible to tell Blount that the meeting was not
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>accidental.</p>

<p>"Pull up a chair and sit down," said Blount, not
too ungraciously, considering his just cause to be
more ungracious. "I was thinking of you a little
while ago, Dick. I saw your name in the list of
Transcontinental representatives to the traffic meeting
in Boston, and&#8212;well, at the present moment
I'm not sure but you are the one man in the world
I wanted most to meet."</p>

<p>"Say! that sounds pretty good to me," laughed
Gantry, settling himself comfortably in a lazy-chair
and feeling in his pockets for a cigar. "I've been
in Boston the full week, skating around over the
chilly crust of things and never able to get so much
as one tenuous little social claw-hold. Say, Evan,
how many ice-plants does that impenetrable old
town keep going ever count 'em?"</p>

<p>"Boston is all right when you know it&#8212;or, rather,
when it comes to know you," returned Blount, remembering
that Boston or Cambridge&#8212;which is
Boston in the process of elucidation&#8212;was the birth
and dwelling place of Patricia.</p>

<p>Gantry grinned broadly and lighted his cigar.</p>

<p>"The 'effete East' has psychically and psychologically
corralled yo<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>u, hasn't it, Evan?&#8212;to put it in
choice Bostonese. I thought maybe it would when
I heard you were taking the post-graduate frills in
the Harvard Law School. By the way, how much
longer are you in for?"</p>

<p>"I am out of the Law School, if that is what you
mean&#8212;out and admitted to the bar," said Blount.
"If you get into trouble with the Boston police let
me know, and I'll ask for a change of venue to the
greasewood hills and Judge Lynch's court."</p>

<p>"The good old greasewood hills!" chanted Gantry,
who was of those who curse their homeland to
its face and praise it consistently and pugnaciously
elsewhere. "Are you ever coming back to them,
Blount? I believe you told me once, in the old
college days, that you were Western-born."</p>

<p>"I told you the truth; and until to-night I have
never thought much about going back," was Blount's
rather enigmatic reply.</p>

<p>"But now you are thinking of it?" inquired the
railroad man, waking up. "That's good; the old
Sage-brush State is needing a few bright young
lawyers mighty bad. Is that why I'm the particular
fellow you wanted to meet?"</p>

<p>Blount passed the telegram which had come while
he was at dinner across the interval between the
two chairs. "Read that," he said.</p>

<p>Gantry smoothed the square of yellow paper carefully
and held it up to the softened glow of the electric
ceiling-globe. Its date-line carried the name of
his own city in the "greasewood country"&#8212;the capital
of the State&#8212;and the time-markings sufficiently
indicated its recent arrival. Below the date-line he
read:</p>
<p><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span class="smcap">To Evan Shelby Blount</span>,</p>

<p>Standish Apartments, Boston.
</p>

<p>You have had everything that money could buy, and
you owe me nothing but an occasional sight of your face.
If you are not tied to some woman's apron-string, why
can't you come West and grow up with your native State?</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">David Blount.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>It was characteristic of Richard Gantry, light-handed
juggler of friendly phrases, but none the
less a careful and methodical official of a great railway
company, that he folded the telegram in the
original creases before he passed it back.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Blount, when the pause had grown
over-abundantly long.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking," was the reflective rejoinder.
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>"We used to be fairly chummy in the old Ann Arbor
days, Evan, and yet I never, until a few days ago,
knew or guessed that Senator Blount was your
father."</p>

<p>"He was and is," was the quiet reply. "I supposed
everybody knew it."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> didn't," Gantry denied, adding: "You may
not realize it, but what you don't tell people about
yourself would make a pretty big book if it were
printed."</p>

<p>Blount's smile was altogether friendly.</p>

<p>"What's the use, Richard?" he asked. "The
world has plenty of banalities and commonplaces
without the adding of any man's personal contribution.
Why should I bore you or anybody?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, if you put it on that ground,"
said the railroad traffic manager. "Just the same,
there's another side to it. In an unguarded moment,
back in the college days, as I have said, you
admitted to me that you were Western-born. I always
supposed afterward that you regretted either
the fact or the mention of it, since you never told
me any more."</p>
<p><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></p>
<p>"Perhaps I didn't tell more because there was so
little to tell. I had a boyhood like other boys&#8212;or,
no, possibly it wasn't quite the usual. I was
born on the 'Circle-Bar,' when the ranch was&#8212;as it
still is, I believe&#8212;a hard day's drive for a bunch
of prime steers distant from the nearest shipping-corral
on the railroad. At twelve I could 'ride line,'
'cut out,' and 'rope down' like any other healthy
ranch-bred youngster, and since the capital was at
that time only in process of getting itself surveyed
and boomed into existence I had never seen a town
bigger than Painted Hat."</p>

<p>"And what happened when you were twelve?"
queried Gantry. He was not abnormally curious,
but Blount's communicative mood was unusual
enough to warrant a quickening of interest.</p>

<p>"The greatest possible misfortune that can ever
come to a half-grown boy, Dick&#8212;my mother
died."</p>

<p>Gantry's own boyhood was not so deeply buried
in the past as to make him forgetful of its joys and
sorrows. "That was hard&#8212;mighty hard," he assented.<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
Then: "And pretty soon your father married
again?"</p>

<p>"Not for some years," Blount qualified. "But
for me the heavens were fallen. I was sent away
to school, to college, to Europe; then I came here
to the Law School. In all that time I've never
seen the 'Circle-Bar' or my native State&#8212;in fact,
I have never been west of Chicago."</p>

<p>Gantry was astonished and he admitted it in exclamatory
phrase. As a railroad man, continent-crossing
travel was to him the merest matter of
course. Though he might Sunday-over at the Winnebasset
Country Club on the North Shore, it was
well within the possibilities that the following week-end
might find him sweltering in New Orleans or
buttoning his overcoat against the raw evening fogs
of San Francisco.</p>

<p>"Never been west of Chicago?" he echoed.
"Never been&#8212;" He stopped short, beginning to
realize vaguely that there must be strong reasons;
reasons which might lie beyond the pale of a college
friendship, and the confidences begotten thereby, in
the rendering of them.</p>
<p><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></p>
<p>"No," said Blount.</p>

<p>"Then the senator's&#8212;that is&#8212;er&#8212;your father's
political life has never touched you."</p>

<p>The friendly smile rippled again at the corners of
Blount's steady gray eyes, but this time it was shot
through with a faint suggestion of the Blount grimness.</p>

<p>"It has touched me on the sympathetic side, Dick.
I saw a large-hearted, open-handed old cattle-king
wading good-naturedly into the muddy stream of
politics to gratify an ambition that wasn't at all
his own&#8212;a woman's ambition. In order that the
woman might mix and mingle in Washington society
for a brief minute or two, he got himself elected to
fill out an unexpired term of two months in the
United States Senate&#8212;bought the election, some
said. That was three years ago, wasn't it?&#8212;a long
time, as political incidents or accidents go. But
Washington hasn't forgotten. When I was down
there last winter the five-o'clock-tea people were
still recalling Mrs. Blount's gowns and the wild-Western
naïveté of 'The Honorable Senator Sage-Brush.'"</p>

<p>Gantry was chuckling softly when the half-bitter
admission had got itself fully made.</p>
<p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></p>
<p>"Land of love, Evan!" he said, "you may be an
educated post-graduate all right, with the proper
Boston degree of culture laid on and rubbed down
to a hard-glaze finish, but you've got a lot to learn
yet&#8212;about the senator and his politics, I mean.
Why, Great Snipes, man! he isn't in it a little bit
for the social frills and furbelows; he never was.
Let me intimate a few things: Politically speaking,
David Blount is by long odds the biggest man in
his State to-day. He can have anything he wants,
from the head of the ticket down. You spoke rather
contemptuously just now of his two months in the
Senate; you probably didn't know that he might
have gone back if he had wanted to; that he actually
did a much more difficult thing&#8212;named his
successor."</p>

<p>David Blount's son stood up and put his shoulders
against one of the veranda pillars. From the
new view-point he could look through the reading-room
windows and on into the assembly-room where
the dancers were keeping time to the measures of a
two-step. But he was not thinking of the dancers
when he said:</p>

<p>"It's a sheer miracle, Dick, your dropping down
here to-night like the <i>deus ex machina</i> of the old
Greek plays. You've read this telegram"&#8212;holding
up the folded message&#8212;"it is just possible that
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>you can tell me what lies behind it. Why has my
father sent it at this particular time and in those
words? He knows perfectly well that my plans for
settling here in Boston were definitely made more
than a year ago."</p>

<p>"I can tell you the situation out in the greasewood
country, if that's what you want to know,"
said Gantry after a thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>"Make it simple," was Blount's condition, adding:
"What I don't know about the business or the political
situation in the West would fill a much larger
book than the one you were speaking of a few minutes
ago."</p>

<p>"'Business or political,' you say; they are Siamese
twins nowadays," returned the railroad man, with
a short laugh. Then: "The outlook for us out yonder
in the greasewood hills is precisely what it is in a
dozen other States this year&#8212;east, west, north and
south&#8212;everything promising a renewal of the unreasoning,
bull-headed legislative fight against the
railroads. I suppose our own case is typical. As
everybody knows, the Transcontinental Railway has
practically created two-thirds of the States through
which it passes&#8212;made them out of whole cloth.
Where you left sage-brush and bare hills and unfenced
cattle ranges a dozen years ago you will now
find irrigation, tilled farm<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>s, orchards, rich mines&#8212;development
everywhere, with a rapidly growing
population to help it along. To make all this possible,
the railroad took a chance; it was a mighty
long chance, and somebody has to pay the bills."</p>

<p>"I know," smiled Blount; "the bill-paying is
summed up in some railroad man's clever phrase,
'all the tariff the traffic will stand.' I can remember
one year when my father rose up in his wrath
and drove his beef cattle one hundred and fifty miles
across the Transcontinental tracks to the Overland
Central."</p>

<p>"That was in the old days," protested Gantry,
who was loyal to his salt. "As the State has filled
up, we've tried to meet the situation half-way, as a
straight business proposition. Fares and tariffs have
been lowered from time to time, and&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>"You are not making it simple enough by half,"
warned Blount quizzically. "You are getting further
away from my telegram every minute."</p>

<p>Gantry paused to relight his cigar.</p>

<p>"I don't know how your telegram figures in it
specially, but I do know this: the legislature to be
elected this fall in our State will be chosen entirely
without regard to the old party lines. There is only
one issue before the people and that is the Transcontinental
Railway. The 'Paramounters<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>,' as they
call themselves, taking the name from the assumption
that it is the paramount duty of the voter to
pinch any business interest bigger than his own,
would like to legislate us out of existence; as against
that we shall beat the tomtom and do our level
best to stay on top of earth."</p>

<p>"Naturally," Blount agreed, then half-absently,
and with his eyes still resting upon the merrymakers
twirling like paired automatons in the distant
assembly-room: "And my father&#8212;how does he
stand?"</p>

<p>"The idea of your having to ask me how the
senator stands in his own State!" exclaimed Gantry.
"But really, Evan, I'd give a good bit of hard
cash to be able to tell you in so many words just
where he does stand. There are a good many people
in our neck of woods who would like mighty well to
know. It will make all the difference in the world
when it comes to a show-down."</p>

<p>"Why will it?"</p>

<p>"Because, apart from the railroad and the anti-railroad
factions, there is a very complete and
smoothly running machine organization."</p>

<p>"And my father is identified with the machine?"</p>

<p>Again Gantry choked over the singular lack of<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
information discovering itself in Blount's question.</p>

<p>"Land of glory!" he ejaculated. "Where have
you been burying yourself, Evan? Didn't I just
tell you that he is the biggest man in the State?
Oh, no"&#8212;with heavy irony&#8212;"he isn't identified
with the machine&#8212;not at all; he merely owns it
and runs it. We may think we can swing a safe
majority in the legislature, and the 'antis' may be
just as firmly convinced that they can. But before
either side can turn a wheel it will have to walk up
to the captain's office and get its orders."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Blount, and a little later: "Thank
you, Dick, I am pretty badly out of touch with the
Western political situation, as you've discovered."
Then he changed the subject abruptly. "How long
will your traffic meeting last?"</p>

<p>"We practically finished to-day. An hour or two
on Monday will wind it up."</p>

<p>"After which you'll go West?"</p>

<p>"After which I shall go West by the Monday noon
train if I can make it. You couldn't hire me to
stay in Boston an hour longer than I have to."</p>

<p>Silence for a time until Blount broke in upon
Gantry's tapping of the dance-music rhythm with:
"If I can close up a few unfinished business matters
and get ready I may go with you, Dick. Would<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
you mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I should mind so much that I'd willingly
miss a train or so and worry out a few more of the
chilly Boston hours rather than lose the chance of
having you along."</p>

<p>"That is good of you, I'm sure. I should bore
myself to death if I had to travel alone."</p>

<p>Blount's rejoinder might have passed for a mere
friendly commonplace if it had not been for the
rather curiously worded telegram. But it was a
goodly portion of Gantry's business in life to put
two and two together, and that phrase in the senator's
message about a woman's apron-string interested
him. Moreover, it was subtly suggestive.</p>

<p>"Ever meet your father's&#8212;er&#8212;the present Mrs.
Blount, Evan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No." Blount may have been Western-born, but
the chilling discouragement he could crowd into the
two-letter negation spoke eloquently of his Eastern
training.</p>

<p>Gantry was rebuffed but not disheartened.</p>

<p>"She is a mighty fine woman," he ventured.</p>

<p>"So I have been given to understand." This
time Blount's reply was icy. <a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>But now Gantry's
eyes were twinkling and he pressed his advantage.</p>

<p>"You'll have to reckon pretty definitely with her
if you go out to the greasewood country, Evan.
Next to your father, she is the court of last resort;
indeed, there are a good many people who insist
that she <i>is</i> the court&#8212;the power behind the throne,
you know."</p>

<p>There is one ditch out of which the most persistent
and gladsome mocker may not drive his victim,
and that is the ditch of silence. Blount said nothing.
Nevertheless, Gantry tried once more.</p>

<p>"Not interested, Evan?"</p>

<p>Blount turned and looked his companion coldly
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest degree, Dick. Will you take
that for your answer now, and remember it hereafter?"</p>

<p>"Sure," laughed the railroad man. And then, to
round out the forbidden topic by adding worse to
bad: "I didn't know it was a sore spot with you.
How should I know? But, as I say, you'll have to
reckon with her sooner or later, and&#8212;"</p>
<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></p>
<p>"Let's talk of something else," snapped Blount.</p>

<p>Gantry found a match and relighted his cigar.
When he began again he was still thinking of the
"apron-string" clause in the senator's telegram.</p>

<p>"I can't understand how any man with Western
blood in his veins could ever be content to marry
and settle down in this over-civilized neck of woods,"
he remarked, looking down upon the parked automobiles
and around at the country-club evidences
of the civilization.</p>

<p>"Can't you?" smiled Blount, with large lenience.
One of the things the civilization had done for him
was to make him good-naturedly tolerant of the
crudeness of the outlander.</p>

<p>"No, I can't," asserted the Westerner. Then he
added: "Of course, I don't know the Eastern young
woman even by sight. She may be all that is lovely,
desirable, and enticing&#8212;if a man could hope to live
long enough to get really well acquainted with
her."</p>
<p><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></p>
<p>"She is," declared Blount, with the air of one
who had lived quite long enough to know.</p>

<p>Once more Gantry was putting two and two together.
Blount's determination to go West and
grow up with the country&#8212;his father's country&#8212;was
apparently a very sudden one. Had the decision
turned entirely upon the senator's telegram?
Gantry, wise in his generation, thought not.</p>

<p>"You say that as if you'd been taking a few lessons,"
he laughed. Then, with the friendly impudence
which only a college comradeship could
excuse: "Is she here to-night?"</p>

<p>"No," said Blount, unguardedly making the response
which admitted so much more than it said.</p>

<p>"Tell me about her," Gantry begged. "I don't
often read a love story, but I like to hear 'em."</p>

<p>If it had been any one but Gantry, Blount would
probably have had a sharp attack of reticence, with
outward symptoms unmistakable to the dullest.
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>But the time, the surroundings, and the exceeding
newness of Patricia's "No" combined to break down
the barriers of reserve.</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell, Dick," he began half
humorously, half in ill-concealed self-pity. "I've
known her for a year, and I've loved her from
the first day. That is Chapter One; and Chapter
Two ends the story with one small word. She says
'No.'"</p>

<p>"The dickens she does!" said Gantry, in hearty
sympathy. Then: "But that's a good sign, isn't
it? Haven't I heard somewhere that they always
say 'No' at first?"</p>

<p>Blount laughed in spite of himself. Gantry, the
Dick Gantry of the college period, had always been
a man's man, gay, light-hearted, and care-free to the
outward eye, but in reality one who was carrying
burdens of poverty and distress which might well
have crushed an older and a stronger man. There
had been no time for sentiment then, and Blount
wondered if there had been in any later period.</p>
<p><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></p>
<p>"I am afraid I can't get any comfort out of that
suggestion," he returned. "When Miss Patricia
Anners says 'No,' I am quite sure she means it."</p>

<p>"Think so?" said Gantry, still sympathetic.
"Well, I suppose you are the best judge. Tough,
isn't it, old man? What's the obstacle?&#8212;if you
can tell it without tearing the bandages off and
saying 'Ouch!'"</p>

<p>"It is Miss Anners's career."</p>

<p>"H'm," was the doubtful comment; "I'm afraid
you'll have to elaborate that a little for me. I'm
not up in the 'career' classification."</p>

<p>"She has been studying at home and abroad in
preparation for social-settlement work in the large
cities. Of course, I knew about it; but I thought&#8212;I
hoped&#8212;"</p>

<p>"You hoped it was only a young woman's fad&#8212;which
it probably is," Gantry cut in.</p>

<p>"Y-yes; I'm afraid that was just what I did hope,
Dick. But I couldn't talk against it. Confound it
all, you can't go about smashing ideals for the
people you love best!"</p>

<p>"Rich?" queried Gantry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Her father has the chair of paleontology,
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>and never gets within speaking distance of the
present century. The mother has been dead many
years."</p>

<p>"And you say the girl has the Hull House ambition?"</p>

<p>"The social-betterment ambition. It's an ideal,
and I can't smash it. You wouldn't smash it, either,
Dick."</p>

<p>"No; I guess that's so. If I were in your fix
I should probably do what you are doing&#8212;say
'Good-by, fond heart,' and hie me away to the forgetful
edge of things. And it's simply astonishing
how quickly the good old sage-brush hills will help
a man to forget everything that ever happened to
him before he ducked."</p>

<p>Blount winced a little at that. It was no part
of his programme to forget Patricia. Indeed, for
twenty-four hours, or the waking moiety of that
period, he had been assuring himself of the utter
impossibility of anything remotely approaching forgetfulness.
This thought made him instantly self-reproachful;
regretful for having shown a sort of
disloyalty by opening the door of the precious and
sacred things, even to so good a friend as Dick Gantry;
and from regretting to amending was never
more than a step for Evan Blount. There were
plenty of reminiscences to be threshed over, and</p>

<p><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>Blount brought them forward so tactfully that
Gantry hardly knew it when he was shouldered away
from the open door of the acuter personalities.</p>

<p>It was quite late, and the talk had again drifted
around to a one-sided discussion of practical politics
in the Western definition of the term, when Gantry,
pleading weariness on the score of his hard week's
work at the railroad meeting, went to bed. The
summer night was at its perfect best, and Blount
was still wakeful enough to refill his pipe and well-balanced
enough to be thankful for a little solitude
in which to set in order his plans for the newly
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>struck-out future. In the later talk with Gantry
he had learned many things about the political situation
in his native State, things which were
enlightening if not particularly encouraging. Trained
in the ethics of a theoretical school, he knew only
enough about practical politics to be very certain
in his own mind that they were all wrong. And if
Gantry's account could be trusted, there were none
but practical politics in the State where his father
was reputed to be the dictator.</p>

<p>Hitherto his ambition had been to build up a
modest business practice in some Eastern city, and,
like other aspiring young lawyers, he had been filling
out the perspective of the picture with the look
ahead to a possible time when some great corporation
should need his services in permanence. He
was of the new generation, and he knew that the
lawyer of the courts was slowly but surely giving
place to the lawyer of business. Without attempting
to carry the modern business situation bodily
over into the domain of pure ethics, he was still
young enough and enthusiastic enough to lay down
the general principle that a great corporation, being<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
itself a creation of the law, must necessarily be law-abiding,
and, if not entirely ethical in its dealings
with the public, at least equitably just. Therefore
his ideal in his own profession was the man who
could successfully safeguard large interests, promote
the beneficent outreachings of corporate capital,
and be the adviser of the man or men to whom the
greater America owes its place at the head of the
civilized nations.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, though Gantry's attitude had been
uncompromisingly partisan, Blount had failed to
recognize in the railroad official a skilful pleader
for the special interests&#8212;the interests of the few
against those of the many. Hence he was preparing
to go to the new field with a rather strong prepossession
in favor of the defendant corporation.
In their later conversation Gantry had intimated
pretty broadly that there was room for an assistant
corporation counsel for the railroad, with headquarters
in the capital of the Sage-brush State.
Blount assumed that the requirements, in the present
crisis at least, would be politi<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>cal rather than legal,
and in his mind's eye he saw himself in the prefigured
perspective, standing firmly as the defender of
legitimate business rights in a region where popular
prejudice was capable of rising to anarchistic
heights of denunciation and attack.</p>

<p>The picture pleased him; he would scarcely have
been a true descendant of the fighting Blounts of
Tennessee if the prospect of a conflict had been
other than inspiring. If there were to be no Patricia
in his future, ambition must be made to fill all the
horizons; and since work is the best surcease for
any sorrow, he found himself already looking forward
in eager anticipation to the moment when he could
begin the grapple, man-wise and vigorously, in the
new environment.</p>

<p>It was after the ashes had been knocked from the
bedtime pipe that Blount left his chair and the secluded
corner of the veranda to go down among the
parked automobiles on the lawn. His one recreation&#8212;and
it was the only one in which he found
the precious fillip of enthusiasm&#8212;was motoring.
There was a choice collection of fine cars in the
grouping on the lawn, and Blount had just awakened
a sleepy chauffeur to ask him to uncover and exhibit
the engine of a freshly imported Italian machine,
when a stir at the veranda entrance told him that at
least a few of the dancing gu<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>ests were leaving early.</p>

<p>Being more curious at the moment about the
mechanism of the Italian motor than he was about
people, he did not realize that he was an intruder
until the chauffeur hastily replaced the engine bonnet
and began to get his car ready for the road.
Blount stepped back when the little group on the
veranda came down the steps preceded by a club
footman who was calling the number of the car.
And it was not until he was turning away that he
found himself face to face with a very beautiful and
very clear-eyed young woman who was buttoning
an automobile dust-coat up under her chin.</p>

<p>"Patricia!" he burst out. And then: "For
Heaven's sake! you don't mean to tell me that you
have been here all evening?"</p>

<p>Her slow smile gave the impression, not quite of
frigidity perhaps, but of that quality of serene self-possession
which strangers sometimes mistook for
coldness.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be here?" she asked. "Didn't
you know that the Cranfords&#8212;the people who are
entertaining&#8212;are old friends of ours?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></p>
<p>Blount shook his head. "No, I didn't know it;
and because I didn't, I have lost an entire evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; you shouldn't say that," she protested.
"The evening was yours to use as you chose. Mrs.
Beverley told me you were here, and she added that
you had particularly requested not to be introduced
to the Cranfords or their guests. Besides, you
know you don't care anything about dancing."</p>

<p>The chauffeur had placed his other passengers in
the tonneau, and was trying to crank the motor.
Blount was thankful that the new Italian engine was
refusing to take the spark. The delay was giving
him an added moment or two.</p>

<p>"No, I don't care much for dancing; and you
know very well why I couldn't, or wouldn't, be anybody's
good company to-night," he said. Then:
"It was cruel of you to deny me this last evening
by not letting me know that you were here."</p>

<p>"'This last evening'?" she echoed. "Why
'last'?"</p>

<p>"Because I am leaving Boston and New England
to-morrow&#8212;or rather, Monday. It is the only
thing to do."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are taking it this way, Evan,"
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>she deprecated, in the sisterly tone that always
made him hotly resentful. "It hurts my sense of
proportion."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think you haven't any sense of
proportion, Patricia," he retorted half-morosely.
"If you have, I am sure it is frightfully distorted."</p>

<p>The recalcitrant motor had given a few preliminary
explosions, and a white-haired old gentleman in
the tonneau was calling impatiently to Patricia to
come and take her place so that he might close the
door.</p>

<p>"It is you who have the distorted perspective,
Evan," she countered. "But I refused to quarrel
with you last night, and I am refusing to quarrel
with you now. It pleases you to believe that a
woman's place in this twentieth-century world is inevitably
at the fireside&#8212;her own fireside. I don't
agree with you; I am afraid I shall never agree with
you. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going West, Monday."</p>

<p>"How odd!" she commented. "We are going<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
West, too&#8212;father and I&#8212;though not quite so soon
as Monday."</p>

<p>"You are?" he queried. "Whereabout in the
West?"</p>

<p>She did not tell him where. The car motor was
whirring smoothly now, the chauffeur was sliding
into his seat behind the pilot-wheel, and the old
gentleman in the tonneau was growing quite violently
impatient.</p>

<p>"If we are both going in the same direction we
needn't say good-by," she said hastily, giving him
her hand at parting. "Let it be <i>auf wiedersehen</i>."
Then the clang of the closing tonneau door and the
outgoing rush of the big car coincided so accurately
that Blount had to spring nimbly aside to
save himself from being run down.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<h3>THE BOSS</h3>
<p><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></p>

<p>It is a far cry from Boston to the land of broken
mountain ranges, lone buttes, and irrigated mesas,
and a still farther one from the veranda of an exclusive
North Shore club to a private dining-room in
the Inter-Mountain Hotel, whose entrance portico
faces the Capitol grounds in the chief city of the
Sage-brush State, whose eastern windows command
a magnificent view of the Lost River Range,
and from whose roof, on a clear day, one may see
the snowy peaks of the Sierras notching the distant
western horizon.</p>

<p>Allowing for the difference between Eastern and
Mountain time, the dinner for two in the private
dining-room of the Inter-Mountain synchronized
very fairly with the threshing out of college reminiscences
by the two young men whose apparently fortuitous
meeting on the veranda of the far-away
North Shore club-house one of them, at least, was
ascribing to the good offices of the god of chance.</p>

<p>On the guest-book of the Inter-Mountain one of
the men at the table in the private dining-room had
registered from Chicago. The name was illegible
to the cursory eye, but since it was the signature
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>of a notable empire-builder, it was sufficiently well
known in all the vast region served by the Transcontinental
Railway System. The owner of the
name had finished his ice, and was sitting back to
clip the end from a very long and very black cigar.
He was a man past middle-age, large-framed and
heavy, with the square, resolute face of a born
master of circumstances. Like the younger generation,
he was clean shaven; hence there was no
mask for the deeply graven lines of determination
about the mouth and along the angle of the strong,
leonine jaw. In the region traversed by the great
railway system the virile face with the massive jaw
was as familiar as the illegible signature on the
Inter-Mountain's guest-book. Though he figured
only as the first vice-president of the Transcontinental
Company, Hardwick McVickar was really
the active head of its affairs and the dictator of its
policies.</p>

<p>Across the small round table sat the railway
magnate's dinner-guest, a man who was more than
McVickar's match in big-boned, square-shouldered
physique, and whose half-century was written only
in the thick, grizzled hair and heavy, graying
mustaches. Like McVickar, he had the lion-like
face of mastership, but the fine wrinkle<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>s at the
corners of the wide-set eyes postulated a sense of
humor which was lacking in his table companion.
His mouth, half hidden by the drooping mustaches,
needed the relieving wrinkles at the corners of the
eyes; it was a grim, straight-lined inheritance from
his pioneer ancestors&#8212;the mouth of a man who may
yield to persuasion but not easily to opposition.</p>

<p>"I wish I could convince you that it isn't worth
while to hold me at arm's-length, Senator," McVickar
was saying, as he clipped the end from his
cigar. "You know as well as I do that under the
present law in this State we are practically bankrupt.
We are not making enough to pay the fixed charges.
We do a losing business from the moment we cross
your State line."</p>

<p>"Yes; it seems to me I have heard something that
sounded a good deal like that before," was the noncommittal
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"You have heard the simple truth, then. And it
is a bald injustice, not only to the railroad company,
but to the people it serves. We can't give adequate
service when the cost exceeds the earnings. That
is the simplest possible proposition in any business
undertaking."</p>

<p>"And you can't make out t<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>o convince the members
of the State Railroad Commission of the simpleness?"
asked the man whom the vice-president
addressed as "Senator."</p>

<p>"You know well enough that we can't hope to
convince a rabidly anti-railroad commission," was
the half-angry retort.</p>

<p>"Yet you are still running your railroad," suggested
the other. "We don't hear anything about
your shutting down and tearing up the track."</p>

<p>"No; luckily, the Transcontinental System does
not lie wholly within your State boundaries. If it
did, we might as well surrender our charter and go
out of business&#8212;shut down and tear up the track,
as you put it."</p>

<p>"All of which has come to be a pretty old and
well-worn story with us, McVickar," said the listener
quietly. "I'm sure you didn't make me
motor thirty miles to hear you tell it all over again.
What do you want?"</p>

<p>"We want a square deal," was the curt reply.</p>

<p>"So do the people of this State," asserted the
man across the table. "You bled us, Hardwick&#8212;bled
us to the queen's taste&#8212;while you had the
chance; and the chance lasted a blamed long time.
You are equitably, if not legally, in debt to<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a> every
man in this State who had ever shipped a car-load
of freight or paid a passenger fare over your line
before the present rate law went into effect. You
can shuffle and side-step all you want to, but that is
the plain fact of the matter."</p>

<p>The vice-president sat up and braced his arms on
the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"You are too much for me, Blount&#8212;you hold
out too many cards; and I'm no apprentice at the
game, either. In all these years we've been dickering
together you've always been a hard-bitted and
consistent fighter for your own hand. What's happened
to you lately? Have you acquired a new set
of convictions? Or have you been figuring out a
different way of whipping the devil around the
stump?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," returned the guest, with
large good-nature. "We are all growing older&#8212;and
wiser, perhaps. You don't deny the debt you
owe us, do you?"</p>

<p>"Do we owe you anything, Blount?" asked the
magnate pointedly, and with a definite emphasis
upon the personal pronoun. "If we do, we are willing
to pay it in spot cash, on demand."</p>
<p><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></p>
<p>The big man on the other side of the table was
leaning back in his chair with his hands in his
pockets, and the smile wrinkling at the corners of
his eyes was half-genial, half-satirical.</p>

<p>"It's lucky we're alone, McVickar," he remarked.
"A third fellow standing around and hearing you
talk might imagine that you are trying to bribe me."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Blount; this is between us two,
and we understand each other. Nothing for nothing
is the accepted rule the world over, and we
both recognize it. You are figuring on something;
I know you are. Name it. If it is anything less
than a mortgage on the earth and one or two of
the planets I'll get it for you."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we are a good deal more than a mile
or two apart yet, McVickar," said the man who was
not smoking, after a long minute. "Let's ride back
to the beginning and get us a fresh start. I said
that Gordon is going to be the next governor of the
State."</p>

<p>"I know you did; and I said&#8212;and I say it again&#8212;he
isn't going to be&#8212;not if we can help it," declared
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>the railway magnate, with emphatic determination.</p>

<p>"The methods you will take to defeat him will
insure his election, McVickar. You fellows are
mighty slow to learn your lesson; mighty slow and
obstinate, Hardwick. You don't know anything
but wire-pulling and crookedness and bribery. The
times have changed, and you haven't had the
common-sense or the courage or the business
shrewdness to change with them. I say Gordon will be
the next governor."</p>

<p>Again there was a strained silence like that which
follows the hand-shake in the prize-ring when the
two antagonists have drawn apart and are warily
watching each for his opening. After the pause the
vice-president said:</p>

<p>"If we had the safest kind of a majority in both
houses of the legislature, we couldn't be sure of
accomplishing anything worth while with Gordon in
the governor's office; you know that, Blount. If
Gordon runs and is elected, his platform will be
flatly anti-railroad."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," was the calm rejoinder.
"Gordon is a mighty square fellow; an honest man
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>and a fair one. If you could stay out of the fight
and go to him with clean hands&#8212;but you couldn't
do that, McVickar; you're too badly out of
practice."</p>

<p>"We needn't go into that phase of it. We are
so savagely handicapped in this State that we can't
afford to take a divided chance; can't afford to pass
our case up to a man who has been elected by an
unfriendly opposition. If we should wash our hands
of the fight, as you suggest, we might just as well
throw up our franchises and quit, so far as any
prospect of earning a reasonable return upon our
investment here is concerned."</p>

<p>"I know; that is what you always say, and you
have said it so often&#8212;you and your fellow railroad
string-pullers&#8212;that you have lost the straightforward
combination completely. If you ever knew how to
make a clean fight you've forgotten the moves, and
it's your own fault."</p>

<p>Once more the man with the fierce eyes and the<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
dominating jaw took time to consider. Like others
of his class, he was partisan only in the sense of one
fighting hardily for the side upon which he had
happened to be drawn in the great world battle. If he
had not long ago parted with his convictions, the
heat and smoke of the battle had obscured them,
and he chose his weapons now with little regard for
anything beyond their possible efficacy.</p>

<p>"You are sparring with me, Blount," he said
finally. "You are talking to me as you might talk
to a committee of the Good Government League&#8212;and
possibly for the same reason. Let's get together.
You control the political situation in your State, and
we frankly recognize that fact. It's a matter of
business, and we can settle it on a business basis.
I have been outspoken and above-board with you
and have told you what we want. Meet me halfway
and tell me what you want."</p>

<p>"I want a square deal all around, Hardwick;
that's all. You've got to take the same ground
and make a clean fight if you want me with you.
I can't make it any plainer than that, can I?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></p>
<p>"I don't know yet what you are driving at,"
frowned the vice-president, "nor just why you have
taken this particular occasion to read me a
kindergarten lecture on political methods. In times past
I suppose we have both done some things that we
would like to have decently buried and forgotten,
but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"But right there we break apart, McVickar,"
cut in the other, setting his jaw with a peculiar
hardening of the facial muscles that gave him the appearance
of a fierce old viking attacking at the head of
his squadrons. "I'm telling you over again that a
new day has dawned in American politics; I and
my kind recognize it, and you and your kind don't
seem to be big enough to recognize it. That is the
difference between us. In the present instance it
comes down to this: you are going to fight for a
railroad majority in the legislature, and you want
Reynolds for the head of the ticket because you
know that you can depend upon his veto if you
don't get your majority in the House and Senate.
You are not going to get Reynolds, or the majority
either, without the help of the party organization."</p>

<p>"We can put it much more elementally than
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>that," supplemented the railroad man. "We get
nothing without your say-so as the head of the
party organization. That is precisely why I have
come a couple of thousand miles to ask you to eat
dinner with me here to-night."</p>

<p>"I reckon I ought to feel right much set up and
biggitty over that, Hardwick," smiled the veteran
spoilsman, relapsing, as he did now and then, into
the speech of his Southern boyhood. And then
half-quizzically: "Are you tolerably well satisfied
that you've got around to the place where you are
willing to tote fair with me? You recollect, I gave
you a straight pointer two years ago; you wouldn't
take it, and we did you up. Are you right certain
you are ready now to holler 'enough'?"</p>

<p>Once again the vice-president refused to be
hurried into making a capitulative admission. When
he spoke, the militant second thought of the fighting
corporation commander chose the words.</p>

<p>"There is a limit to all things, Senator, and you
are pushing us pretty well up to it. I suppose you
can crack the whip and swing the vote on the
legislature, and you can take it and be damned. But,
by God, we'll have our governor and our attorney-general!"</p>

<p>"You are betting confidently on that, are you?"
said the veteran mildly.<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a> "Is that your declaration
of war?"</p>

<p>"Call it anything you like. We are not going to
be legislated off the map if we can help it. Strong
as your machine is, you can't swing Gordon in
against Reynolds if we concede your bare majority
in the legislature and put up the right kind of a fight.
And when it comes to Rankin, our candidate for
attorney-general, you simply haven't another man
in the party to put up against him. You'd have
to run in a dummy, and even you are not big enough
to do that, Blount, and put it over."</p>

<p>"You've settled this definitely in your own mind,
have you, Hardwick?" was the placable rejoinder.
"I'm sorry&#8212;right sorry. I've been hoping that you
had learned your lesson&#8212;you and your tribe. I
came to town this evening prepared to show you a
decent way out of your troubles, so far as this State
is concerned; but since you have posted your 'de-fi,'
as we cow-punchers say, I reckon it isn't worth while
to wade any deeper into the creek."</p>

<p>Again the railroad magnate rested his arms on the<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
table-edge. "What was your 'decent way,' Senator?"
he asked, fixing his gaze upon the shrewd old
eyes of the other, which, for the first time in the
conference, seemed to be losing a little of their
grimly good-natured aggressiveness.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you, though you will likely
call it an old man's foolishness. I have a grown
son, McVickar. Did you know that?"</p>

<p>The vice-president nodded, and the big man
opposite went on half-reminiscently:</p>

<p>"He is a lawyer, and a mighty bright one, so they
tell me. As I happen to know, he is pretty well up
on the corporation side of the argument, and the one
thing I've been afraid of is that he would marry
and settle down somewhere in the East, where the
big corporations have their home ranches. I'm getting
old, Hardwick, and I'd like mighty well to have
the boy with me. Out of that notion grew another.
I said to myself this: Now, here's McVickar; if
he could have a good, clean-cut young man in this
State representing his railroad&#8212;a man who not
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>only knew his way around in a court-room, but
who might also know how to plead his client's case
before the public&#8212;if McVickar could have such a
young fellow as that for his corporation counsel,
and would agree to make his railroad company live
somewhere within shouting distance of such a young
fellow's ideals, we might all be persuaded to bury
the hatchet and live together in peace and amity."</p>

<p>A slow smile was spreading itself over the strong
face of the railway magnate as he listened.</p>

<p>"Say, David," he retorted mildly, "it isn't much
like you to go forty miles around when there is a
short way across. Why didn't you tell me plainly in
the beginning that you wanted a place for your boy?"</p>

<p>"Hold on; don't let's get too far along before we
get started; I'm not saying it now," was the sober
protest. "You forget that you've just been telling
me that you don't intend to comply with the one
hard-and-fast condition to such an arrangement as
the one I've been pipe-dreaming about."</p>

<p>"What condition?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></p>
<p>"That you turn over a brand-new leaf and meet
the people of this State half-way on a proposition
of fair play for everybody."</p>

<p>"There isn't any half-way point in a fight for life,
David. You know that as well, or better, than I
do. But let that go. We'll give your son the place
you want him to have, and do it gladly."</p>

<p>The man who had once been his own foreman of
round-ups straightened himself in his chair and
smote the table with his fist.</p>

<p>"No, by God, you won't&#8212;not in a thousand
years, McVickar! Maybe you could buy me&#8212;maybe
you <i>have</i> bought me in times past&#8212;but you
can't buy that boy! Listen, and I'll tell you what
I'm going to do. I telegraphed the boy this afternoon,
telling him to throw up his job in Boston and
come out here. If he comes within a reasonable
time he will be legally a citizen of the State before
election. You said we didn't have anybody but
Rankin to run for attorney-general. By Heavens,
Hardwick, I'll show you if we haven't!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hardwick McVickar was not of those who
fight as one beating the air. While the deft waiter
was clearing the table and serving the small coffees
he kept silence. But when the time was fully ripe
he said what there was to be said.</p>
<p><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></p>
<p>"You've got us by the nape of the neck, as usual,
Blount. Name your terms."</p>

<p>"I have named them. Get in line with the new
public opinion and we'll do what we can for you."</p>

<p>During the long pause following this curt ultimatum
the masterful dictator of railroad policies
deliberated thoughtfully upon many things. With
the ex-senator as the all-powerful head of the machine
in this State of many costly battle-fields, it
would have been a weakness inexcusable on the
part of so astute a commander as McVickar if
David Blount's history, political and personal, had
not been known to him in all its details. As a contingency
to be met sooner or later, the vice-president
had anticipated the thing which had now come to
pass. That Blount should wish to push the fortunes
of his son was perfectly natural; and it was no less
natural that he should push them by making the
railroad company's pay-roll furnish the motive-power.
The magnate smiled inwardly when he remembered
that he had given Gantry, the division
traffic manager of the Transcontinental, a quiet hint
to look up one Evan Blount, a young lawyer, on
his next visit to Boston. By all odds it would be
better to wait for Gantry's report before taking
any irrevocable steps in the bargaining with Evan
Blount's father; but unhappily the crisis had arrived,
and in all probability it could not be postponed<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>.
None the less, the vice-president tried craftily
for the postponement.</p>

<p>"You're asking a good deal, Blount, and you don't
seem to realize it. You are practically demanding
that we lay down our arms and put a possible enemy
in the saddle on the eve of a battle. If we should
agree to meet the people of this State half-way, as
you suggest, what guarantee have we that we won't
be compelled to go all the way?"</p>

<p>The fine-lined wrinkles were appearing again at
the corners of the hereditary Blount eyes.</p>

<p>"You can't quite rise to the occasion, can you,
Hardwick?" smiled the boss. "You'd like to behave
yourself and be good, of course; but you want
to be cocksure beforehand that it isn't going to
cost too much."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, I'm going to ask for a little time
in which to consider it," was the vice-president's
final word.</p>

<p>"Sure! You have all the time there is between
now and the election. Go on and do your considering.
I've told you what I'm going to do."</p>

<p>"You know very well that we can't allow you to
do what you propose. With an unfriendly attorney-<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>general
we might as well throw up our hands first
as last."</p>

<p>"All right; it's right pointedly up to you," was
the calm reply.</p>

<p>The vice-president rose and dusted the cigar-ash
from his coat-sleeve with the table-napkin. When
he looked up, the heavy frown was again furrowing
itself between his eyes.</p>

<p>"Let me know when your son is coming and
I'll try to make it possible to meet him here," he
said rather gratingly.</p>

<p>And thus, at the precise moment when Richard
Gantry, some three thousand miles away to the
eastward, was declaring his weariness and his intention
of going to bed, the two-man conference in the
Inter-Mountain private dining-room was closed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></p>
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>A FALSE GALLOP OF MEMORIES</h3>


<p>As a churlish fate decreed, it turned out that
Evan Blount was not to have Gantry for a travelling
companion beyond Chicago. On the second day of
westward faring the railroad traffic manager, whose
business followed him like an implacable Nemesis
wherever he went, had wire instructions to stop
and confer with his vice-president in the Illinois
metropolis. Hence, on the morning of the following
day, Blount continued his journey alone.</p>

<p>Twenty-odd hours later the returning expatriate
had crossed his Rubicon; in other words, his train
had rolled through the majestic steel bridge spanning
the clay-colored flood of the Missouri River at
Omaha, and he was entering upon scenes which
ought to have been familiar&#8212;which should have
been and were not, so many and striking were the
changes which had been wrought during his fourteen
years of absence.</p>

<p>Though h<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>e was far enough from realizing it,
his education and the Eastern environment had
given him a touch of Old-World insularity. The
through sleeper in which he had his allotment of
space was well filled, and there were the usual opportunities
for the making of passing acquaintanceships
in the smoking-compartment. But it was not
until the second day, after the dining-car luncheon
and its aftermath of a well-chosen cigar had broken
down some of the barriers of the acquired reserve,
that he fell into talk with the prosperous-looking
gentleman who had seized upon the only chair
in the smoking-compartment&#8212;a man whose thin,
hawk-like face, narrowly set eyes, and uneasy manner
were singularly out of keeping with the fashionable
cut of his clothes, with his liberal tips, and
with the display of jewelry on his watch-fob.</p>

<p>At first the conversation was baldly desultory, as
it was bound to be, with an escaped lover, whose
disappointment was still rasping him like a newly
devised Nessus shirt, to sustain an undivided half
of it. The hawk-faced one, who had boarded the
train at Omaha and whose section was directly
oppos<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>ite Blount's, defined himself as a mine-owner
whose property, vaguely located as somewhere "in
the mountains," was involved in litigation.</p>

<p>It was the reference to the litigation which first
drew Blount beyond the boundaries of the commonplaces.
Oddly enough, considering the fact that
his planned-for Eastern career would have given
him little occasion to dip into the mining codes, he
had specialized somewhat in mining law. Hence,
when the hawk-faced man had told his story, Blount
found himself thawing out sufficiently to be suggestively
helpful to the man who had apparently purchased
more trouble than profits in his mining
ventures.</p>

<p>Into the cleft thus opened by the axe of human
sympathy the man in the wicker chair presently
inserted a wedge of cautious inquiry touching another
matter. In addition to his mining ventures he
had been making investments in timber-lands, or,
rather, in certain lumber companies operating "in
the mountains"&#8212;bad investments, he feared, since
the Government had lately taken such a decided
stand against the cutting of timber in the mountain-land
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>reserves and water-sheds. Was it likely, he
asked, that the talk would materialize in restraining
action? If so, he was in the hole again&#8212;worse
off than he should be if his mining lawsuits should
go against him.</p>

<p>Again Blount, good-naturedly charitable and not
a little amused by the nervous anxiety of the gentleman
of many troubles, gave an opinion.</p>

<p>"Conservation, in timber as well as in other remaining
resources of the country, has come to be
a word which is in everybody's mouth," was the
form the opinion took. "The plain citizen who isn't
familiar with the methods of the timber sharks
would do well to keep his money out of their hands
if he doesn't wish to be held as <i>particeps criminis</i>
with them in the day of reckoning."</p>

<p>"Say!" ejaculated the thin man, wriggling nervously
in his chair. "If you were a Government
agent yourself you could hardly put the case stronger
for the conservation crowd!"</p><p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></p>

<p>Now, in ordinary circumstances, nothing was ever
farther from Blount's normal attitude toward his
fellow-men than a disposition to yield to the sudden
joking impulse. But the hawk-faced man's perturbation
was so real, or so faultlessly simulated, that
he could not resist the temptation.</p>

<p>"How do you know that I am not a Government
agent?" he demanded, with a decent show of gravity.</p>

<p>"Because you are not travelling on Government
transportation," was the shrewd retort.</p>

<p>At another time Blount might have wondered
why a casual fellow-traveller should have taken the
trouble to make the discovery. But at the moment
he was intent only upon keeping the small misunderstanding
alive.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have seen my ticket, but you
can't tell anything by that," he countered, laughing.
"A good many civilian employees of the Government
travel nowadays on regular tickets, like other
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>people."</p>

<p>"I know damned well they do," admitted the
anxious one; and then, with a swift eye-shot which
Blount missed: "Especially if they happen to be
travelling on the quiet to catch some poor devil
napping on the job."</p>

<p>"You needn't be alarmed; you haven't told me
anything that the department could make use of,"
returned Blount, carrying the jest the one necessary
move farther along.</p>

<p>It was precisely at this point, as Blount remembered
afterward, that the timber-thieving subject
was dropped. Later on, after the talk had drifted
back to mining, and from mining to politics, the
nervous gentleman pleaded weariness and declared
his intention of going to his section to take a nap,
and presently disappeared to carry it out.</p>

<p>Blount was not sorry to be left alone. In response
to a vague stirring of something within
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>him&#8212;a thing which might have been the primitive
underman yawning and stretching to its awakening&#8212;he
had been trying in the window-facing intervals
to reconstruct the passing panorama of mountain
and plain upon the recollections of his boyhood.
As yet there was little familiarity save in the
broader outlines. Where he remembered only the
fallow-dun prairie, dotted with dog-mounds, there
were now vast ranches planted to sod corn; and
upon the hills the cattle ranges were no longer open.
The towns, too, at which the train made its momentary
stops, were changed. The straggling shack
hamlets of the cattle-shipping period, with the shed-roofed
railroad station, the whitewashed loading-corral,
and the towering water-tank&#8212;all backgrounded
by a thin line of saloons and dance-halls&#8212;had
disappeared completely, and the window-watcher
found himself looking in vain for the flap-hatted,
cigarette-smoking horsemen with which the
West of his boyhood had been chiefly peopled.</p>

<p>Farther along toward evening the great range,
which had been visible for hours in the westward
vista, began to define itself in peaks and high, bald
shoulderings of wind-swept mesas. Here was something
definite and tangible for the stirring underman
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>to lay hold upon. Blount, the sober-minded,
the self-contained, found a curious transformation
working itself out in quickened pulses and exhilarating
nerve-tinglings. Boston, the Law School, the
East of the narrow walk-ways and the still narrower
rut of custom and convention, were fading into a
past which already seemed age-old and half forgotten.
He threw open the window at his elbow and
drank in deep inspirations of the hill-sweeping blast.
It was sweet in his nostrils, and the keen crispness
of it was as fine wine in his blood. After all, he had
been but a sojourner in the other world, and this
was his homeland.</p>

<p>At the dining-car dinner, which was served while
the higher peaks of the main range were as vast
islands floating in a sea of crimson and gold, Blount
missed the man of many troubles. The dining-car
was well filled, and, though the faces of the diners
were all unfamiliar, the hum of talk, the hurrying
of the waiters, and the subdued clamor drowning
itself in the under-drone of the drumming wheels
answered well enough for companionship. There
are times when even the voice of a friend is an intrusion,
and the returning exile had happed upon
one of them. Largeness, the inspiring breadth of
the immensities, was what he craved most; and
when he had cut the many-coursed dinner short, he
hurried back to his Pullman window, hoping that
he might have the smoking-compartment to himself
again.</p>

<p>The unspoken wish was granted. When he entered
the smoking-room he found it empty; and,
filling his cutty pipe, he drew the cushioned wicker
chair out to face the open window. <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>Fresh glimpses
of the northward landscape shortly brought a renewal
of the heart-stirrings; and when he finally
had the longed-for sight of a bunch of grazing cattle,
with the solitary night-herd hanging by one leg in
the saddle to watch the passing of the train, the
call of the homeland was trumpeting in his ears,
and he would have given anything in reason to be
able to changes places, temporarily at least, with
the care-free horseman whose wiry, muscular figure
was struck out so artistically against the dun-colored
hillside.</p>

<p>"Would I really do such a thing as that?" he
asked himself half incredulously, when the night-herd
and his grazing drove had become only a picturesque
memory; and out of the heart-stirrings
and pulse-quickenings came the answer: "I more
than half believe that I would&#8212;that I'd jump at
the chance." Then he added regretfully: "But
there isn't going to be any chance."</p>

<p>"Any chance to do what?" rumbled a mellow
voice at his elbow, and Blount turned quickly to
find that a big, bearded man, smoking an abnormally
corpulent cigar, had come in to take his seat
on the divan.</p>
<p><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></p>
<p>At another time Blount, the conventional Blount,
would have been self-conscious and embarrassed, as
any human being is when he is caught talking to
himself. But with the transformation had come a
battering down of doors in the house of the broader
fellowship, and he laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"You caught me fairly," he acknowledged. "I
thought I still had the place to myself."</p>

<p>"But the chance?" persisted the big man, looking
him over appraisively. "You don't look like a man
who has had to hang round on the aidges hankerin'
after things he couldn't get."</p>

<p>"I guess I haven't had to do that very often,"
was the reflective rejoinder. "But a mile or so
back we passed a bunch of cattle, with the night
man riding watch; I was just saying to myself that
I'd like to change places with that night-herd&#8212;only
there wasn't going to be any chance."</p>

<p>The bearded man's laugh was a deep-chested
rumbling suggestive of rocks rolling down a declivity.</p>

<p>"Lordy gracious!" he chuckled. "If you was to
get a leg over a bronc', and the bronc' should find
it out&#8212;<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>Say, I've got a li'l' blue horse out on my
place in the Antelopes that'd plumb give his ears
to have you try it; he shore would. You take my
advice, and don't you go huntin' a job night-ridin'
in the greasewood hills. Don't you do it!"</p>

<p>"I assure you I hadn't thought of doing it for
a permanency. But just for a bit of adventure,
if the chance should offer while I'm in the notion.
I believe I'd take it. I haven't ridden a cow-pony
for fourteen years, but I don't believe I've lost the
knack of it."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said the big man. "Then you ain't as
much of a tenderfoot as you look to be. Shake!"
and he held out a hand as huge as a bear's paw.
Following the hand-grip he grew confidential.
"'Long in the afternoon I stuck my head in at the
door and saw you chewin' the rag with a thin-faced
old nester that couldn't set still in his chair while
he talked. Know him?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Blount promptly. "He has
the section opposite mine, and he got on at Omaha."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't want to know him if I was
you," was the bearded man's co<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>mment. Then:
"Tryin' to get you to invest in some o' his properties?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"Well, he will, if he gets a chance. He'd go furder'n
that; he'd nail you up to the cross and skin
you alive if there was any money in it for him.
His name's Simon Peter, and it ort to be Judas.
I know him down to the ground!"</p>

<p>"Simon Peter?" said Blount inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Ya-as; Simon Peter Hathaway. And my name's
Griggs; Griggs, of the Antelopes, back o' Carnadine&#8212;if
anybody should ask you who give you your
pointer on Simon Peter Judas. I don't blacklist no
man in the dark, and I've said a heap more to that
old ratter's face than I've ever said behind his
back. Ump! him a-wrigglin' in that chair you're
settin' in and tryin' to fix up some way to skin
you! Don't tell me! I know blame' well what he
was tryin' to do."</p>

<p>Blount listened and was interested, not so much
in the bit of gossip as in the big, red-faced ranchman,
who so evidently had a grudge to pay off.</p>
<p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></p>
<p>"I am not likely to have any dealings with Mr.
Hathaway," he rejoined. "And I must do him the
bare justice of saying that he wasn't trying to sell
me anything. The shoe was on the other foot. He
seemed to be afraid he was in danger of losing out,
and he was asking my advice."</p>

<p>"S.P. Hathaway lose out? Not on your life, my
young friend! You say he was askin' for advice?
You've done stirred up my curiosity a whole heap,
and I reckon you'll have to tell me who you are
before it'll ca'm down again."</p>

<p>Blount laughed. "Mr. Hathaway thinks I am
a special agent for the Government, travelling on
business for the Forest Service."</p>

<p>"The hell he does!" exploded the big man. Then
he reached over and laid a swollen finger on Blount's
knee. "Say, boy, before you or him ever gets off
this train&#8212;Sufferin' Moses! what was that?"</p>

<p>The break came upon a thunderous crash transmitting
itself from car to car, and the long, heavy
train came to a juggling stop. The ranchman
sprang to his feet with an alacrity surprising in so
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>huge a body and ducked to look out of the open
window.</p>

<p>"Twin Buttes!" he gurgled. "And, say, it's a
wreck! We've hit something right slap in the middle
of the yard! Let's make a break for the scene
of the confliggration till we see who's killed!"</p>

<p>Blount followed the ranchman's lead, but shortly
lost sight of the burly figure in the crowd of curious
passengers pouring from the hastily opened vestibules.
Seen at closer range, the accident appeared
to be disastrous only in a material sense. The
heavy "Pacific-type" locomotive had stumbled over
the tongue of a split switch, leaving the rails and
making a blockading barrier of itself across the
tracks. Nobody was hurt; but there would be a
delay of some hours before the track could be
cleared.</p>

<p>Finding little to hold him in the spectacle of the
derailed locomotive, Blount strolled on through the
railroad yard to the station and the town. He remembered
the place chiefly by its name. In his
boyhood it had been the nearest railroad forwarding-point
for the mines at Lewiston, thirty miles
beyond the Lost Hills. Now, as it appeared, it
had become a lumber-shipping station. To the left
of the railroad there were numerous s<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>awmills, each
with its mountain of waste dominated by a black
chimney, screen-capped. For the supply of logs an
enormous flume led down from the slopes of the
forested range on the south, a trough-like water-chute
out of which, though the working-day was
ended, the great logs were still tumbling in an intermittent
stream.</p>

<p>North of the town the valley broke away into a
region of bare mesas dotted with rounded, butte-like
hills, with the buttressing ranges on either side
to lift the eastern and western horizons. The northern
prospect enabled Blount to place himself accurately,
and the tide of remembrance swept strongly
in upon him. Some forty-odd miles away to the
northeast, just beyond the horizon-lifting lesser
range, lay the "short-grass" region in which he had
spent the happy boyhood. An hour's gallop through
the hills to the westward the level rays of the setting
sun would be playing upon the little station
of Painted Hat, the one-time shipping-point for the
home ranch. And half-way between Painted Hat
and the "Circle-Bar," nestling in the hollowed hands
of the mountains, were the horse-corrals of one<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a> Debbleby,
a true hermit of the hills, and the boy Evan's
earliest school-master in the great book of Nature.</p>

<p>Blount's one meliorating softness during the years
of exile had manifested itself in an effort to keep
track of Debbleby. He knew that the old horse-breeder
was still alive, and that he was still herding
his brood mares at the ranch on the Pigskin. The
young man, fresh from the well-calculated East,
threw up his head and sniffed the keen, cool breeze
sweeping down from the northern hills. He was
not given to impulsive plan-changing. On the contrary,
he was slow to resolve and proportionately
tenacious of the determination once made. But the
stirring of boyish memories accounted for something;
and in the sanest brain there are sleeping
cells of irresponsibility ready to spring alive at the
touch of suggestion. What if he should&#8212;</p>

<p>He sat down upon the edge of the station platform
and thought it out deliberately. Since it would
be hours before the tracks could be cleared and the
rail journey resumed, what was to prevent him from
taking an immediate and delightful plunge into the
region of the heart-stirring recollections? Doubtless
old Jason Debbleby was at this moment sitting on the
door-step of his lonely ranch-house in the Pigskin
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>foot-hills, smoking his corn-cob pipe and, quite possibly,
wondering what had become of the boy whom
he had taught to "rope down" and saddle and ride.
Blount estimated the distance as he remembered it.
With a hired horse he might reach Debbleby's by
late bedtime; and after a night spent with the old
ranchman he could ride on across the big mesa to
the capital.</p>

<p>Another ineffectual attempt to find out how soon
the relief train from the capital might be expected
decided Blount. Arranging with the Pullman conductor
to have his hand-luggage left in Gantry's
office at the capital, the man in search of his boyhood
crossed quickly to a livery-stable opposite the
station, bargained for a saddle-horse, borrowed a
poncho and a pair of leggings, and prepared to
break violently, for the moment at least, with all
the civilized traditions. He would go and see Debbleby&#8212;drop
in upon the old horse-breeder without
warning, and thus get his first revivified impression
of the homeland unmixed with any of the disappointing
changes which were doubtless awaiting him at
the real journey's end.</p>
<p><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></p>
<p>Now it chanced that the livery-stable was an adjunct
to the single hotel in the small sawmill town,
and as Blount was mounting to ride he saw the thin-faced
man, whom the ranchman, Griggs, had named
for him, standing on the porch of the hotel in earnest
talk with three others who, from their appearance,
might have figured either as "timber jacks" or cowboys.
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>Blount was on the point of recognizing his
companion of the Pullman smoking-compartment as
he rode past the hotel to take the trail to the northward,
but a curious conviction that the gentleman
with the bird-of-prey eyes was making him the subject
of the earnest talk with the three men of doubtful
occupation restrained him. A moment later,
when he looked back from the crossing of the
railroad track, he saw that all four of the men on
the porch were watching him. This he saw; and
if the backward glance had been prolonged for a
single instant he might also have seen a big, barrel-bodied
man with a red face stumbling out of the side
door of the shack hotel to make vigorous and commanding
signals to stop him. But this he missed.</p>

<p>There was an excuse for the oversight as well as
for the speedy blotting out of the picture of the
four men watching him from the porch of the hotel.
With a fairly good horse under him, with the squeak
of the saddle-leather in his ears and the smell of it
in his nostrils, and with the wide world of the immensities
into which to ride unhampered and f<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>ree,
the lost boyhood was found. Not for the most soul-satisfying
professional triumph the fettered East
could offer him would he have curtailed the free-reined
flight into the silent wilderness by a single
mile.</p>

<p>For the first half-hour of the invigorating gallop
the fugitive from civilization had the sunset glow to
help him find the trail. After that the moon rose,
and the landmarks, which had seemed more or less
familiar in daylight, lost their remembered featurings.
During the first few miles the trail had
led broadly across the table-land, with the eastern
mountains withdrawing and the Lost River
Range looming larger as its lofty sky-line was struck
out sharply against the sunset horizon. Farther on,
in the transition darkness between sunset and moonrise,
the trail disappeared entirely; but so long as
he was sure of the general direction, Blount held on
and gave the tireless little bronco a loose rein. The
Debbleby ranch lay among the farther foot-hills
of the western range, with the broad gulch of the
Pigskin cutting a plain highway through the mountains.
If he could find one of the head-water streams
of the Pigskin, all of which took their rise in the
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>gulches of the mesa, there could be no danger of
losing the way.</p>

<p>It was some little time after he had left the
shoulderings of the eastern range behind that a singular
thing happened. Far away on his right he
heard the sound of galloping hoofs. Though the
moon was nearly full and the treeless landscape
was bare of any kind of cover, he could not make
out the horseman who was evidently passing him
and going in the same direction. At first he thought
it was some one who was making a <i>détour</i> to avoid
him. Then he smiled at the absurdity of the guess
and concluded that he himself was off the trail.
This conclusion was confirmed a little later when
two other travellers, announcing themselves to the
ear as the first one had, and also, like the first, invisible
to the sharpest eye-sweep of the moonlit plain,
passed him at speed.</p>

<p>After that Blount had the solitudes and vastnesses
to himself, and it was not until after the
mesa-land had been crossed without a sign of a
water-leading gulch to guide him to the Pigskin,
and the bronco was patiently picking its way through
the hogback of the western range, that the boyish
thing he had been led to do took shape as an adventure
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>which might have discomforting consequences.</p>

<p>For, after the hired bronco had wandered aimlessly
through many gulches and had climbed a good
half-score of the hogback hills, the young man from
the East admitted that the boyhood memories were
hopelessly and altogether at fault in the deceptive
moonlight. Blount gave the horse a breathing halt
on one of the hogbacks and tried to reconstruct the
puzzling hills into some featuring that he could remember.
The effort was fruitless. He was very
thoroughly and painstakingly lost.</p>

<h3>THE HIGHBINDERS</h3>


<p>When the three men who had pulled him from
his horse and tied him hand and foot had withdrawn
to the farther side of the tiny camp-fire to wrangle
morosely over what should be done with him, Evan
Blount found it simply impossible to realize that
they were actually dis<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>cussing, as one of the expedients,
the propriety of knocking him on the head
and flinging his body into the near-by canyon.</p>

<p>The difficulty of comprehension lay in the crude
grotesqueness of the thing that had happened. Five
minutes earlier he had been riding peacefully up
the trail in the moonlight, wondering how thoroughly
he was lost and how much farther it was to Debbleby's.
Then, at a sudden sharp turn in the canyon
bridle-path, he had stumbled upon the camp-fire,
had heard an explosive "Hands up!" and had
found himself confronted by three men, with one of
the three covering him with a sawed-off Winchester.
From that to the unhorsing and the binding had
been merely a rough-and-tumble half-minute, inasmuch
as he was unarmed and the surprise had been
complete; but the grotesquery remained.</p>

<p>Since his captors had as yet made no attempt to
rob him, he could only surmise that some incredibly
foolish mistake had been made. But when he
remembered the three invisible horsemen who had
passed him on the broad mesa he was not so certain
about the mistake. Most naturally, his thoughts
went back to the little episode on the hotel porch.
The passing glance he had given to the three men
with whom the fourth man, Hathaway, had been
talking did not enable him to identify them with
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>the three who were sourly discussing his fate at the
near-by fire; none the less, the conclusion was fairly
obvious. Thus far he had been either too busy or
too bewildered to break in; but when the more murderous
of the expedients was apparently about to be
adopted, he decided that it was high time to try to
find out why he was to be effaced. Whereupon he
called across to the group at the fire.</p>

<p>"Without wishing to interfere with any arrangements
you gentlemen are making, I shall be obliged
if you will tell me why you think you have found
it necessary to murder me."</p>

<p>"You know mighty good and well why there's
one too many of you on Lost River, jest at this
stage o' the game," growled the hard-faced spokesman
who had held the Winchester while his two
accomplices were doing the unhorsing and the binding.</p>

<p>"But I don't," insisted Blount good-naturedly.
"So far as I know, there is only one of me&#8212;on Lost
River or anywhere else."</p>

<p>"That'll do for you; it ain't your put-in, nohow,"
was the gruff decision of the court; but Blount was
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>too good a lawyer to be silenced thus easily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you might not especially regret killing
the wrong man, but in the present case I am very
sure I should," he went on. And then: "Are you
quite sure you've got the right man?"</p>

<p>"The boss knows who you are&#8212;that's enough
for us."</p>

<p>"The boss?" questioned Blount.</p>

<p>"Yas, I said the boss; now hold your jaw!"</p>

<p>Blount caught at the word. In a flash the talk
with Gantry on the veranda of the Winnebasset
Club flicked into his mind.</p>

<p>"There is only one boss in this State," he countered
coolly. "And I am very sure he hasn't given
you orders to kill me."</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded the spokesman.</p>

<p>Blount repeated his assertion, adding jocularly:
"Perhaps you'd better call up headquarters and
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>ask your boss if he wants you to kill the son of his
boss."</p>

<p>At this the gun-holder came around the fire to
stand before his prisoner.</p>

<p>"Say, pal&#8212;this ain't my night for kiddin', and
it hadn't ort to be your'n," he remarked grimly.
"The boss didn't say you was to be rubbed out&#8212;they
never do. But I reckon it would save a heap
o' trouble if you <i>was</i> rubbed out."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I'm inclined to think it would
make a heap of trouble&#8212;for you and your friends,
and quite probably for the man or men who sent
you to waylay me. But, apart from all that, you've
got hold of the wrong man, as I told you a moment
ago."</p>

<p>"No, by grapples! I hain't. I saw you in daylight.
If there's been any fumblin' done, I hain't
done it. So you see it ain't any o' my funeral."</p>

<p>"Think not?" said Blount.</p>

<p>"I know it ain't. Orders is orders, and you
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>don't git over into them woods on Upper Lost
Creek with no papers to serve on nobody: see?"</p>

<p>It was just here that the light of complete understanding
dawned upon Blount; and with it came
the disconcerting chill of a conviction overthrown.
As a theorist he had always scoffed at the idea that
a corporation, which is a creature of the law, could
afford to be an open law-breaker. But here was a
very striking refutation of the charitable assumption.
His smoking-room companion of the Pullman
car was doubtless one of the timber-pillagers who
had been cutting on the public domain. To such
a man an agent of the National Forest Service was
an enemy to be hoodwinked, if possible, or, in the
last resort, to be disposed of as expeditiously as
might be, and Blount saw that he had only himself
to blame for his present predicament, since he
had allowed the man to believe that he was a Government
emissary. Having this clew to the mystery,
his course was a little easier to steer.</p>

<p>"I have no papers of the kind you think I have,
as you can readily determine by searching me," he
said. "My name is Blount, and I am the son of
ex-Senator David Blount, of this State. Now what
are you going to do with me?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></p>
<p>"What's that you say?" grated the outlaw.</p>

<p>"You heard what I said. Go ahead and heave
me into the canyon if you are willing to stand for
it afterward."</p>

<p>The hard-faced man turned without replying and
went back to the other two at the fire. Blount
caught only a word now and again of the low-toned,
wrangling argument that followed. But from the
overheard word or two he gathered that there were
still some leanings toward the sound old maxim
which declares that "dead men tell no tales."
When the decision was finally reached, he was left
to guess its purport. Without any explanation the
thongs were taken from his wrists and ankles, and
he was helped upon his horse. After his captors
were mounted, the new status was defined by the
spokesman in curt phrase.</p>

<p>"You go along quiet with us, and you don't make
no bad breaks, see? I more'n half believe you been
lyin' to me, but I'm goin' to give you a chance to
prove up. If you don't prove up, you pass out&#8212;that's
all. Now git in line and hike out; and if
you're countin' on makin' a break, jest ricollect that
a chunk o' lead out of a Winchester kin travel a
heap faster thern your cayuse."</p>
<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></p>
<p>If Blount had not already lost all sense of familiarity
with his surroundings, the devious mountain
trail taken by his captors would soon have convinced
him that the boyhood memories were no
longer to be trusted. Up and down, the trail zigzagged
and climbed, always penetrating deeper and
deeper into the heart of the mountains. At times
Blount lost even the sense of direction; lost it so
completely that the high-riding moon seemed to be
in the wrong quarter of the heavens.</p>

<p>For the first few miles the trail was so difficult
that speed was out of the question; but later, in
crossing a high-lying valley, the horses were pushed.
Beyond the valley there were more mountains, and
half-way through this second range the trail plunged
into a deep, cleft-like canyon with a brawling torrent
for its pathfinder. Once more Blount lost the sense
of direction, and when the canyon trail came out
upon broad uplands and became a country road
with bordering ranches watered by irrigation canals,
into which the mountain torrent was diverted, there
were no recognizable landmarks to tell him whither
his captors were leading him.</p>

<p>As he was able to determine by holding his
watch, face up, to the moonlight, it was nearly midnight
when the silent cavalcade of four turned aside
from the main road into an avenue of spreading
cottonwood trees. At its head the avenue became
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>a circular driveway; and fronting the driveway a
stately house, with a massive Georgian facade and
colonnaded portico, flung its shadow across the
white gravel of the carriage approach.</p>

<p>There were lights in one wing of the house, and another
appeared behind the fan-light in the entrance-hall
when the leader of the three highbinders had
tramped up the steps and touched the bell-push.
Blount had a fleeting glimpse of a black head
with a fringe of snowy wool when the door was
opened, but he did not hear what was said. After
the negro serving-man disappeared there was a
little wait. At the end of the interval the door
was opened wide, and Blount had a gruff order to
dismount.</p>

<p>What he saw when he stood on the door-mat
beside his captor merely added mystery to mystery.
Just within the luxuriously furnished hall, where
the light of the softly shaded hall lantern served
to heighten the artistic effect of her red housegown,
stood a woman&#8212;a lady, and evidently the
mistress of the Georgian mansion. She was small
and dark, with brown eyes that were almost childlike
in their winsomeness; a woman who might
be twenty, or thirty, or any age between. Beautiful
she was not, Blount decided, comparing her instantly,
as he did all women, with Patricia Anners;
but&#8212;He was not given time t<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>o add the qualifying
phrase or to prepare himself for what was
coming.</p>

<p>"What is it, Barto?" the little lady asked, turning
to the man with the gun.</p>

<p>The reply was direct and straight to the purpose.</p>

<p>"Excuse <i>me</i>; but I jest wanted to ask if you know
this here young feller. He's been allowin' to me
th't he is&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Of course," she said quickly, and stepping forward
she gave her hand and a welcome to the dazed
one. "Please come in; we have been expecting
you." Then again to the man with the Winchester:
"Thank you so much, Barto, for showing the gentleman
the way to Wartrace Hall."</p>

<p>It was all done so quietly that Blount was still
unconsciously holding the hand of welcoming while
his late captors were riding away down the cottonwood-shaded
avenue. When he realized what he
was doing he was as nearly embarrassed as a selfcontained
young lawyer could well be. But his
impromptu hostess quickly set him at ease.</p>
<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></p>
<p>"You needn't make any explanations," she hastened
to say, smiling up at him and gently disengaging
the hand which he was only now remembering
that he had forgotten to relinquish. "Naturally,
I inferred that you were in trouble, and that your
safety depended in some sense upon my answer.
Were you in trouble?"</p>

<p>Blount perceived immediately how utterly impossible
it would be to make her, or any one else,
understand the boyish impulse which had prompted
him to leave his train, or the curious difficulty into
which the impulse had precipitated him. So his explanation
scarcely explained.</p>

<p>"I was on my way to a ranch&#8212;that is, to the capital&#8212;when
these men held me up," he stammered.
"They&#8212;they mistook me for some one else, I think,
and for reasons best known to themselves they
brought me here. If you could direct me to some
place where I can get a night's lodging&#8212;"</p>

<p>"There is nothing like a tavern within twenty
miles of here," she broke in; "nor is there any
house within that radius which would refuse you a
night's shelter, Mr.&#8212;"</p>

<p>Blount made a quick dive for his card-case, found
it, and hastened to introduce himself by name. She
took the bit of pasteboard, and, since she scarcely
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>glanced at the engraved line on it, he found himself
wholly unable to interpret her smile.</p>

<p>"The card is hardly necessary," she said; and
then, to his complete bewilderment: "You are very
much like your father, Mr. Blount."</p>

<p>"You know my father?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She laughed softly. "Every one knows the senator,"
she returned, "and I can assure you that
his son is heartily welcome under this roof. Uncle
Barnabas"&#8212;to the ancient serving-man who was
still hovering in the background&#8212;"have Mr.
Blount's horse put up and the blue room made
ready."</p>

<p>Blount followed his still unnamed hostess obediently
when she led the way to the lighted library</p>

<p>in the wing of the great house.</p>

<p>"Uncle Barnabas will come for you in a little
while," she told him, playing the part of the gracious
lady to the line and letter. "In the meantime
you must let me make you a cup of tea. I
am sure you must be needing it after having ridden
so far. Take the easy-chair, and we can talk comfortably
while the kettle is boiling. Are you new
to the West, Mr. Blount, or is this only a return
to your own? The senator is always talking about<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
you, you know; but he is so inordinately proud of
you that he forgets to tell us all the really interesting
things that we want to know."</p>

<p>The serving-man took his own time about coming
back; so long a time that Blount forgot that it was
past midnight, that he was a guest in a strange
house, and that he still had not learned the name
of his entertainer. For all this forgetfulness the
little lady with the dark-brown eyes was directly
responsible. Almost before he realized it, Blount
found himself chatting with her as if he had always
known her, making rapid strides on the way to confidence
and finding her alertly responsive in whatever
field the talk happened to fall. Apparently
she knew the world&#8212;his world&#8212;better than he knew
it himself: she had summered on the North Shore
and wintered in Washington. She knew Paris, and
when the conversation touched upon the Italian
art-galleries he was led to wonder if he had gone
through Italy with his eyes shut. At the next turn
of the talk he was forced to admit that not even
Patricia herself could speak more intelligently of the
English social problem; and when it came to the
vital questions of the American moment he gasped
again and wondered if he were awake&#8212;if it could
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>be possible that this out-of-place Georgian mansion
and its charming mistress could be part and parcel
of the West which had so far outgrown the boyhood
memories.</p>

<p>Since all things mundane must have an end, the
old butler with the white-fringed head came at last
to show him the way to his luxurious lodgings on
the second floor of the mansion. With a touch of
hospitality which carried Blount back to his one
winter in the South, the hostess went with him as
far as the stair-foot, and her "Good-night" was
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>still ringing musically in his ears when the old negro
lighted the candles in the guest-room, put another
stick of wood on the small fire that was crackling
and snapping cheerfully on the hearth, and bobbed
and bowed his way to the door. Blount saw his
last chance for better information vanishing for the
night, and once more broke with the traditions.</p>

<p>"Uncle Barnabas, before you go, suppose you tell
me where I am," he suggested. "Whose house is
this?"</p>

<p>The old man stopped on the threshold, chuckling
gleefully. "A-ain't you know dat, sah?&#8212;a-ain't de
mistis done tell you dat? You's at Wa'trace Hall&#8212;Mahsteh
Majah's new country-house; yes, sah;
dat's whah you is&#8212;kee-hee!"</p>

<p>"And who is 'Master Major'?" pressed Blount,
whose bewilderment grew with every fresh attempt
to dispel it.</p>
<p><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></p>
<p>"A-ain't she tell you dat?&#8212;kee-hee! Ev'body
knows Mahsteh Majah; yes, sah. If de mistis
ain't tell you, ol' Barnabas ain't gwine to&#8212;no, sah.
Ah'll bring yo'-all's coffee in de mawnin'; yes, sah&#8212;good-night,
sah&#8212;kee-hee!" And the door closed
silently upon the wrinkled old face and the bobbing
head.</p>

<p>Having nothing else to do, Blount went to bed,
but sleep came reluctantly. Life is said to be full
of paper walls thinly dividing the commonplace
from the amazing; and he decided that he had
surely burst through one of them when he had given
place to the vagrant impulse prompting him to go
horseback-riding when he should have gone comfortably
to bed in his sleeper to wait for the track-clearing.</p>

<p>Whither had a curiously bizarre fate led him?
Where was "Wartrace Hall," and who was "Mahsteh Majah"?
Who was the winsome little lady
who looked as if she might be twenty, and had
all the wit and wisdom of the ages at her tongue's
end&#8212;who had held him so nearly spellbound over
the teacups that he had entirely lost sight of everything
but his hospitable welcome?</p>
<p><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></p>
<p>These and kindred speculations kept him awake
for a long time after the door had closed behind
the ancient negro; and he was just dropping off
into his first loss of consciousness when the familiar
purring of a motor-car aroused him. There was a
window at his bed's head, and he reached over and
drew the curtain. The view gave upon the avenue
of cottonwoods and the circular carriage approach.
A touring-car, with its powerful head-lights paling
the white radiance of the moon, was drawn up at
the steps, and he had a glimpse of a big man,
swathed from head to heel in a dust-coat, descending
from the tonneau.</p>

<p>"I suppose that will be 'Mahsteh Majah,'" he
mused sleepily. "That's why the little lady was
sitting up so late&#8212;she was waiting for him." Then
to the thronging queries threatening to return and
keep him awake: "Scat!&#8212;go away! call it a pipe-dream
and let me go to sleep!"</p>

<h3>AT WARTRACE HALL</h3>


<p>In his most imaginative moments, Evan Blount
had never prefigured a home-coming to coincide in
any detail of it with the re<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>ality.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes on the morning following
the night of singular adventures, the sun was
shining brightly in at the bed's-head window, a
cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth, and his
father, a little heavier, a little grayer, but with the
same ruggedly strong face and kindly eyes, was
standing at his bedside.</p>

<p>"Father!"&#8212;and "Evan, boy!" were the simple
words of greeting; but the mighty hand-grip which
went with them was for the younger man a confirmation
of the filial hope and a heart-warming
promise for the future. Following instantly, there
came a rush of mingled emotions: of astoundment
that he had recognized no familiar landmark in the
midnight faring through the hills or on the approach
to the home of his childhood; of something
akin to keen regret that the old had given place so
thoroughly and completely to the new; of a feeling
bordering on chagrin that he had been surprised
into accepting the hospitable advances of a woman
whom he had been intending to avoid, and for whom
he had hitherto cherished&#8212;and meant to cherish&#8212;a
settled aversion.</p>

<p>But at the hand-gripping moment there was no
time for a nice weighing of emotions. He was in
his father's house; the home-coming, some phases
of which he had vaguely dreaded, was a fact accomplished,
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>and the new life&#8212;the life which must
be lived without Patricia&#8212;was fairly begun. Also,
there were many arrears to be brought up.</p>

<p>"Intuition, on the manward side of it at least,
doesn't go," he was saying with half-boyish candor.
"I was awake last night when you drove home in
the motor, and I looked out of the window and saw
you as you came up the steps. According to the
psychics, there ought to have been some inward
stirrings of recognition, but there weren't&#8212;not a
single thrill. Did the little&#8212;er&#8212;did Mrs. Blount
tell you that I was here?"</p>

<p>"She did so; but she couldn't tell me much more.
Say, son, how on top of earth did you happen to
blow in at midnight, with Jack Barto for your herd
leader?"</p>

<p>"It's a fairy tale, and you won't believe it&#8212;of a
Blount," was the laughing reply. "I left Boston
Monday, and should have reached the capital last
night. But my train was laid out by a yard wreck
at Twin Buttes just before dark, and I left it and
took to the hills&#8212;horseback. Don't ask me why
I did such a thing as that; I can only say that the
smell of the sage-brush got into my blood and I
simply had to do it."</p>

<p>The old cattle-king was standing with his feet
planted wide apart and his hands deep in his pockets.
"You hired a horse!" he chuckled, with the humorous
wrinkles coming and going at the corners of th<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>e
kindly eyes. "Did you have the nerve to think
you were going to climb down from a three-legged
stool in a Boston law office one day and ride the
fifty miles from Twin Buttes to the capital the
next?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I wasn't altogether daft. But knowing
where I was, I did think I could ride out to Debbleby's.
So I hired the bronco and set out&#8212;and
that reminds me: the horse will have to be sent
back to the liveryman in Twin Buttes, some way."</p>

<p>"Never mind the cayuse. Shackford would have
made you a present of it outright if you had told
him who you were. Go on with your story. It
listens like a novel."</p>

<p>"I took the general direction all right on leaving
Twin Buttes, and kept it until I got among the Lost
River hogbacks. But after that I was pretty successfully
lost. I'm ashamed to tell it, but about half
of the time the moon didn't seem to be in the right
place."</p>

<p>"Lost, were you? And Jack Barto found you?"
queried the father.</p>
<p><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></p>
<p>"Barto hadn't lost me to any appreciable extent,"
was the half-humorous emendation. And then:
"Who is this ubiquitous Barto who goes around
playing the hold-up one minute and the good angel
the next?"</p>

<p>"He is a sort of general utility man for Hathaway,
the head pusher of the Twin Buttes Lumber Company.
He is supposed to be a timber-cruiser and
log-sealer, but I reckon he doesn't work very hard
at his trade. Down in the lower wards of New York
they'd call him a boss heeler, maybe. But you say
'hold-up'; you don't mean to tell me that Jack
Barto robbed you, son!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he held me up with a gun while his
helpers pulled me off the bronco and hog-tied me,
and then fell to discussing with the other two the
advisability of knocking me on the head and dropping
me into Lost River Canyon&#8212;that's all. Of
course, I knew they had stumbled upon the wrong
man; and after a while I succeeded in making Barto
accept that hypothesis; at least, he accepted it sufficiently
to bring me here for identification. Since
he wouldn't talk, and I didn't recognize the trail
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>or the place, I hadn't the slightest notion of my
whereabouts&#8212;not the least in the world; didn't
know where he was taking me or where I had landed
when we stopped here."</p>

<p>The big man was leaning against the foot-rail of
the bed and frowning thoughtfully. "Talked about
dropping you into Lost River, did they? H'm. I
reckon we'll have to look into that a little. Who
set them on, son? Got any idea of that?"</p>

<p>"I have a very clear idea: it was this man Hathaway
you speak of&#8212;a big ranchman named Griggs
told me his name. He came across in the Pullman
with me from Omaha; middle-aged, tall, and slim,
with a hatchet face and owlish eyes. Before I
learned his name we had talked a bit&#8212;killing time
in the smoking-room. He said he was interested in
mines and timber. Along toward the last he got the
notion into his head that I was a special agent of
some kind, on a mission for the Bureau of Forestry,
and I was foolish enough to let him escape with the
impression uncorrected."</p>

<p>"That was Pete Hathaway, all right," was the<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>
senator's comment. "His company has been cutting
timber in the Lost River watershed reserves,
and he probably thought you were aiming to get
him. You say he sent Barto after you?"</p>

<p>"I'm only guessing at that part of it. When I
rode away from Twin Buttes he was standing on
the porch of the tavern, talking to Barto and two
others; and I'm pretty sure he pointed me out to
them. An hour or so later, three horsemen passed
me on the mesa, one after another. I couldn't see
them, but I heard them. It might have been another
hour or more past that when they potted me."</p>

<p>"You gave them your name?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and that seemed to tangle them a little.
Barto said he believed I was lying, but, anyway,
he'd give me a chance to 'prove up.' Then they
brought me here, and your&#8212;er&#8212;Mrs. Blount kindly
stepped into the breach for me."</p>

<p>"You didn't know Honoria when you saw her?"
queried the father.</p>

<p>"No; I wasn't in the least expecting&#8212;that is, I&#8212;yo<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>u
may remember that I had never met her,"
stammered the young man, who had risen on his
elbow among the pillows.</p>

<p>The older man walked to the window and stood
looking out upon the distant mountains for a full
minute before he faced about to say: "We might
as well run the boundary lines on this thing one
time as another, son. You don't like Honoria;
you've made up your mind you're not going to let
yourself like her. I don't mean to make it hard
for either of you if I can dodge it. This is her
home; but it is also yours, my boy. Do you reckon
you could&#8212;"</p>

<p>Evan Blount made affectionate haste to stop the
half-pathetic appeal.</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you for a minute," he
interposed. "I&#8212;Mrs. Blount is a very different
person from the woman I have been picturing her
to be; and if she were not, I should still try to believe
that we are both sufficiently civilized not to
quarrel." Then: "Have you breakfasted yet&#8212;you
and Mrs. Blount? But of course you have, long
ago."</p>

<p>"Breakfasted?&#8212;without you? Not much, son!
And that reminds me: I was to come up here and
see if you were awake, and if you were, I was to
send Barnabas up with your coffee."</p>

<p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>"You may tell Uncle Barnabas that I haven't
acquired the coffee-in-bed habit yet," laughed the
lazy one, sitting up. "Also, you may make my
apologies to Mrs. Blount and tell her I'll be down
<i>pronto</i>. There; doesn't that sound as if I were getting
back to the good old sage-brush idiom? Great
land! I haven't heard anybody say <i>pronto</i> since
I was knee-high to a hop-toad!"</p>

<p>Farther on, when he was no longer in the first
lilting flush of the new impressions, Evan Blount
was able to look back upon that first day at Wartrace
Hall with keen regret; the regret that, in the
nature of things, it could never be lived over again.
In all his forecastings he had never pictured a homecoming
remotely resembling the fact. In each succeeding
hour of the long summer day the edges of
the chasm of the years drew closer together; and
when, in the afternoon, his father put him on a
horse and rode with him to a corner of the vast
home domain, a corner fenced off by sentinel cottonwoods
and watered by the single small irrigation
ditch of his chil<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>dish recollections; rode with him
through the screening cottonwoods and showed him,
lying beyond them, the old ranch buildings of the
"Circle-Bar," untouched and undisturbed; his heart
was full and a sudden mist came before his eyes to
dim the picture.</p>

<p>"I've kept it all just as it used to be, Evan," the
father said gently. "I thought maybe you'd come
back some day and be sure-enough disappointed if
it were gone."</p>

<p>The younger man slipped from his saddle and
went to look in at the open door of the old ranchhouse.
Everything was precisely as he remembered
it: the simple, old-fashioned furniture, the crossed
quirts over the high wooden mantel, his mother's
rocking-chair ... that was the final touch; he sat
down on the worn door-log and put his face in his
hands. For now the gaping chasm of the years was
quite closed and he was a boy again.</p>

<p>Still later in this same first day there were ambling
gallops along the country roads, and the father explained
how the transformation from cattle-raising
to agriculture and fruit-growing had come about;
how the great irrigation project in Quaretaro Canyon
had put a thousand square miles of the fertile
mesa under cultivation; how with the inpouring of
the new population had come new blood, new methods,
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>good roads, the telephone, the rural mail route,
and other civilizing agencies.</p>

<p>The young man groaned. "I know," he mourned.
"I've lost my birth-land; it's as extinct as the
prehistoric lizards whose bones we used to find
sticking in the old gully banks on Table Mesa. By
the way, that reminds me: are there any of those
giant fossils left? I was telling Professor Anners
about them the other day, and he was immensely
interested."</p>

<p>"We're all fossils&#8212;we older folks of the cattle-raising
times," laughed the man whom Richard
Gantry had called the "biggest man in the State."
"But there are some of the petrified bones left,
too, I reckon. If the professor is a friend of yours,
we'll get him a State permit to dig all he wants
to."</p>

<p>"Yes; Professor Anners is a friend of mine," was
the younger Blount's half-absent rejoinder. But
after the admission was made he qualified it. "Perhaps
I ought to say that he is as much a friend as
his daughter will permit him to be."</p>

<p>The qualifying clause was not thrown away upon<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>
the senator.</p>

<p>"What-all has the daughter got against you,
son?" he asked mildly.</p>

<p>"Nothing very serious," said Patricia's lover,
with a laugh which was little better than a grimace.
"It's merely that she is jealous of any one
who tries to share her father with her. Next to her
career&#8212;"</p>

<p>"That's Boston, isn't it?" interrupted the ex-king
of the cattle ranges. Then he added: "I'm right
glad it hasn't come in your way to tie yourself up
to one of those 'careers,' Evan, boy."</p>

<p>Now all the influences of this red-letter day had
been humanizing, and when Evan Blount remembered
the preservation of the old "Circle-Bar"
ranch-house, and the motive which had prompted
it, he told his brief love-tale, hiding nothing&#8212;not
even the hope that in the years to come Patricia
might possibly find her career sufficiently unsatisfying
to admit the thin edge of some wedge of reconsideration.
He felt better after he had told his
father. It was highly necessary that he should tell
some one; and who better?</p>

<p>David Blount listened wi<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>th the far-away look in
his eyes which the son had more than once marked
as the greatest of the changes chargeable to the
aging years.</p>

<p>"Think a heap of her, do you, son?" he said,
when the ambling saddle-animals had covered another
half-mile of the homeward journey.</p>

<p>"So much that it went near to spoiling me when
she finally made me realize that I couldn't hold my
own against the 'career,'" was the young man's answer.
Then he added: "I want work, father&#8212;that
is what I am out here for; the hardest kind of work,
and plenty of it; something that I can put my heart
into. Can you find it for me?"</p>

<p>There was the wisdom of the centuries in the
gentle smile provoked by this unashamed disappointed
lover's appeal.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take it too hard&#8212;the career business&#8212;if
I were you, son," said the wise man. "And as
for the work, I reckon we can satisfy you, if your
appetite isn't too whaling big. How would a State
office of some kind suit you?"</p>

<p>"Politics?" queried Blount, bringing his horse
down to the walk for which his father had set the
example. "I've thought a good bit about that,
though I haven't had any special training that way.
The schools of to-day are turning out business lawyers&#8212;men
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>who know the commercial and industrial
codes and are trained particularly in their application
to the great business undertakings. That
has been my ambition: to be a business adviser,
and, perhaps, after a while to climb to the top of
the ladder and be somebody's corporation counsel."</p>

<p>"But now you have changed your notion?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; sometimes I wonder if I haven't.
There is another field that is exceedingly attractive
to me, and you have just named it. No man can
study the politics of America to-day without seeing
the crying need for good men: men who will not
let the big income they could command in private
undertakings weigh against pure patriotism and a
plain duty to their country and their fellow-men;
strong men who would administer the affairs of the
State or the nation absolutely without fear or favor;
men who will hew to the line under any and all
conditions. There's an awful dearth of that kind
of material in our Government."</p>

<p>A quaint smile was playing under the drooping
mustaches of that veteran politician the Honorable
Senator Sage-Brush.</p>
<p><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></p>
<p>"I reckon we do need a few men like that, Evan;
need 'em mighty bad. Think you could fill the bill
as one of them if you had a right good chance?"</p>

<p>The potential hewer of political chips which should
lie as they might fall smiled at what seemed to be
merely an expression of parental favoritism.</p>

<p>"I'm not likely to get the chance very soon," he
returned. "Just at present, you know, I am still
a legal resident of the good old Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and a member of its bar&#8212;eligible to
office there, and nowhere else."</p>

<p>"You'd be a citizen of this State by the time you
could get elected to an office in it," suggested the
senator gravely.</p>

<p>"I know; the required term of residence here is
ridiculously short. But you are forgetting that I
am as completely unknown in the sage-brush hills
as you are well known. I couldn't get a nomination
for the office of pound-keeper."</p>

<p>David Blount was chuckling softly as he threw
up the brim of the big sombrero he was wearing.</p>

<p>"Sounds right funny to hear you talking that
way, son," he commented.<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a> "Mighty near everybody
this side of the Bad Lands will tell you that the
slate hangs up behind the door at Wartrace Hall;
and I don't know but what some people would say
that old Sage-Brush Dave himself does most of the
writing on it. Anyhow, there is one place on it that
is still needing a name, and I reckon your name
would fit it as well as anybody's."</p>

<p>The young man who was so lately out of the well-balanced
East was astounded.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" he ejaculated. "You're not considering
me as a possibility on the State ticket before
I've been twenty-four hours inside of the State lines,
are you?"</p>

<p>"No; not exactly as a possibility, son; that isn't
quite the word. We'll call it a sure thing, if you
want it. It's this way: we're needing a sort of political
house-cleaning right bad this year. We have
good enough laws, but they're winked at any day in
the week when somebody comes along with a fistful
of yellow-backs. The fight is on between the
people of this State and the corporations; it was
begun two years ago, and the people got the laws
all right, but they forgot to elect men who would
carry them out. This time it looks as if the voters
had got their knives sharpened. We've been a little
slow catching step maybe, but the marching orders
have gone out. We're aiming to clean house, and
do it right, this fall."</p>

<p>"Not if the slate hangs behind your door&#8212;or an<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>y
man's, father," was the theorist's sober reminder.
"Reform doesn't come in by that road."</p>

<p>"Hold on, boy; steady-go-easy's the word. Reform
comes in by any old trail it can find, mostly,
and thanks its lucky stars if it doesn't run up against
any bridges washed out or any mud-holes too deep
to ford. We've got a good man for governor right
now; not any too broad maybe, but good&#8212;church
good. Nobody has ever said he'd take a bribe; but
he isn't heavy enough to sit on the lid and hold it
down. Alec Gordon, the man who is going to succeed
him next fall, is all the different kinds of things
that the present governor isn't, so that is fixed."</p>

<p>"How 'fixed'?" queried the younger man, who,
though he was not from Missouri, was beginning to
fear that he would constantly have to be shown.</p>

<p>"In the same way that everything has to be
fixed if we are going to get results," was the calm
reply. "After the governor, the man upon whom
the most depends is the attorney-general. The fellow
who is in now, Dortscher, is one of the candidates,
but we've crossed his name off. The next
man we considered was Jim Rankin. In some ways
he's<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a> fit; he's a hard fighter, and the man doesn't
live who can bluff him. But Jim's poor, and he
wants mighty bad to be rich, so I reckon that lets
him out."</p>

<p>All of this was directly subversive of Evan Blount's
ideas touching the manner in which the political
affairs of a free country should be conducted, but
he was willing to hear more.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"What we want this time is one of your hew-to-the-line
fellows, son. Reckon you'd like to try it?"</p>

<p>The young man who was less than a week away
from the atmosphere of the idealistic school and its
theories was frankly aghast. That his father should
be coolly proposing him for a high office in the State
in which, notwithstanding the birthright, he was as
new as the newest immigrant, seemed blankly incredible.
But when the incredibility began to subside,
the despotism of the machine methods which
could propose and carry out such unheard-of things
loomed maleficent.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we are a good many miles apart in
this matter<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a> of politics," he said, when the proposal
had been given time to sink in. "America is supposed
to be a free country, with a representative
government elected by the suffrages of the people;
do you mean to say that you and a few of your
friends ignore the basic principles of democracy to
such an extent that you nominate and elect anybody
you please to any office in the State?"</p>

<p>The far-seeing eyes of the veteran were twinkling
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about our being so far apart,"
was the deprecatory protest. "You're just a little
bit long on theory, that's all, son. When it comes
down to the real thing&#8212;practical politics, as some
folks call it&#8212;somebody has to head the stampede
and turn it. And if we don't do it this coming fall,
the other bunch will."</p>

<p>"What other bunch?"</p>

<p>"In this case it's the corporations: the timber
people, the irrigation companies, and, most of all,<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>
the railroad."</p>

<p>"Gantry seems to think that the railroads&#8212;or
his railroad, at least&#8212;are persecuted."</p>

<p>The senator pulled his horse down to a still slower
walk. "Where did you see Dick Gantry?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Evan told of the meeting on the veranda of the
Winnebasset Club, adding the further fact of the
college friendship.</p>

<p>"Just happened so, did it?" queried the older
man, "that getting together last Saturday night?"</p>

<p>"Why&#8212;yes, I suppose so. Dick knew I was in
Boston, and he said he had meant to look me
up."</p>

<p>"I reckon he did," was the quiet comment; "yes,
I reckon he did. And he filled you up plumb full
of Hardwick McVickar's notions, <i>of</i> course. I reckon
that's about what he was told to do. But we won't
fall apart on that, son. To-morrow we'll run down
to the city, and you can look the ground over for
yourself. I want you to draw your own conclusions,
and then come and tell me what you'd like to do.
Shall we leave it that way?"</p>

<p>Evan Blount acquiesced, quite without prejudice,
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>to a firm conviction that his opinion, when formed,
was going to be based on the larger merits of the
case, upon a fair and judicial summing-up of the
pros and cons&#8212;all of them. He felt that it would
be a blow struck at the very root of the tree of good
government if he should consent to be the candidate
of the machine. But, on the other hand, he saw
instantly what a power a fearless public prosecutor
could be in a misguided commonwealth where the
lack was not of good laws, but of men strong enough
and courageous enough to administer them. He
would see: if the good to be accomplished were
great enough to over-balance the evil ... it was
a temptation to compromise&#8212;a sharp temptation;
and he found himself longing for Patricia, for her
clear-sighted comment which, he felt sure, would
go straight to the heart of the tangle.</p>

<p>It was that thought of Patricia, and his need for
her, that made him absent-minded at the Wartrace
Hall dinner-table that evening; and the father, looking
on, suspected that Evan's taciturnity was an expression
of his prejudice against the woman who had
taken his mother's place. After dinner, when the
son, pleading weariness, retreated early to his room,
the senator's suspicion became a belief.</p><p><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></p>

<p>"You'll have to be right patient with the boy,
little woman," he said to the small person whom
Gantry had described as the court of last resort;
this when Evan had disappeared and the long-stemmed
pipe was alight. "I shouldn't wonder if
Boston had put some mighty queer notions into his
head."</p>

<p>The little lady looked up from her embroidery
frame and a quaint smile was twitching at the corners
of the pretty mouth. "He is a dear boy, and
he is trying awfully hard to hate me," she said.
"But I sha'n't let him, David."</p>

<h3>ON THE WING OF OCCASIONS</h3>
<p><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></p>

<p>From the time when it was heralded in the mammoth
New Year's edition of <i>The Plainsman</i> as "the
newest, the finest, and the most luxurious hostelry
west of the Missouri River," the Inter-Mountain
Hotel, in the Sage-brush capital, had been the
acceptable gathering-place of the clans, industrial,
promoting, or political.</p>

<p>Anticipating this patronage, Clarkson, its bonanza-king
builder and owner, had amended the architect's
plans to make them include a convention-hall,
committee-rooms, and a complete floor of suites
with private dining-rooms. Past this, the amended
plans doubled the floor space of the lobby&#8212;debating-ground
dear to the heart of the country delegate&#8212;and
particular pains had been taken to make
this semi-public forum, where the burning question
of the moment could be caucussed and the shaky
partisan resworn to fealty, attractive and home-like;
the plainly tiled floor, leather-covered lounging-chairs,
and numerous and convenient cuspidors
lending an air of de<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>mocratic comfort which was
somehow missing in the resplendent, bemirrored,
onyx-plated bar, blazing with its cut glass and
polished mahogany.</p>

<p>After the solid costliness of Wartrace Hall and
the thirty-mile spin in a high-powered gentleman's
roadster, which was only one of the three high-priced
motor-carriages in the Wartrace garage, Evan
Blount was not surprised to learn that his father
was registered in permanence for one of the private
dining-room suites at the Inter-Mountain. It was
amply evident that the simple life which had been
the rule of the "Circle-Bar" ranch household had
become a thing of the past; and though he charged
the new order of things to the ambition of his father's
wife, he could hardly cavil at it, since he was
himself a sharer in the comforts and luxuries.</p>

<p>For the first few days after the father and son had
gone into bachelor quarters at the Inter-Mountain,
the returned exile was left almost wholly to his own
devices. Beyond giving him a good many introductions,
as the opportunities for them offered in the
stirring life of<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a> the hotel, his father made few demands
upon him, and they were together only at
luncheon and dinner, the midday meal being usually
served in their suite, while for the dinner they met
by appointment in the hotel <i>café</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this hospitable neglect on the
part of his father, Evan Blount suffered no lack of
the social opportunities. Gantry was back, and, in
addition to a most ready availability as a social
sponsor, the traffic manager was both able and willing.
Almost before he had time to realize it, Blount
had been put in touch with the busy, breezy life of
the Western city, was exchanging nods or hand-shakings
with more people than he had ever known
in Cambridge or Boston, and was receiving more
invitations than he could possibly accept.</p>

<p>"Pretty good old town, isn't it?" laughed Gantry
one day, when he had tolled Blount away from
the Inter-Mountain luncheon to share a table with
him in the Railway Club. "Getting so you feel a
little more at home with us?"</p>

<p>"If I'm not, it isn't your fault, Dick, or the fault
of your friends. Naturally, I expected some sort of
a welcome as ex-Senator David Blount's son; but
that doesn't seem to cut any figure at all."</p><p><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></p>

<p>Gantry's smile was inscrutable.</p>

<p>"The people with whom it cuts the largest figure
will never let you know anything about it. Just
the same, your sonship is cutting a good bit of ice,
if you care to know it. I've met a number of men
in the past few days who have discovered that you
are just about the brainiest thing that ever escaped
from the effete East and the law schools."</p>

<p>"Tommy-rot!" derided the brainy one.</p>

<p>"It's a fact. And they are prophesying all sorts
of a roseate and iridescent future for you. One
might almost imagine that the prophets are inspired
by that kind of gratitude which is a lively sense of
favors to come."</p>

<p>"Oh, piffle! You know that is all nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" queried the railroad man, stressing the
first word meaningly. Then, shifting the point of
attack: "You're mighty innocent, aren't you, old
man? But I think you might have told me. Goodness
knows, I'm as safe as a brick wall."</p>

<p>"Might have told you what?"</p><p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></p>

<p>"That you are going to run for attorney-general
against Dortscher."</p>

<p>"I couldn't very well tell you what I didn't know
myself, Dick," was the sober reply. "Who has been
romancing to you?"</p>

<p>"It's all over town. Everybody's talking about
it&#8212;talking a lot and guessing a good deal more.
You've got 'em running around in circles and uttering
loud and plaintive cries, especially Jim Rankin,
who had&#8212;or thought he had&#8212;a lead-pipe cinch on
the job. Dortscher is tickled half to death. He
knew he wasn't going to be allowed to succeed himself,
and he hates Rankin worse than poison."</p>

<p>Blount was balancing the spoon on the edge of
his coffee-cup and scowling abstractedly. It was
the first little discord in the filial harmony&#8212;this
evidence that the powers were at work; almost a
breach of confidence. There was no avoiding the
distasteful conclusion. Without consulting his wishes,
without waiting for his decision, his father had publicly
committed him&#8212;taken "snap judgment" upon
him was<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a> the way he phrased it.</p>

<p>"Dick, will you believe me if I say that I haven't
authorized any such talk as this you've been hearing?"
he asked, looking up quickly.</p>

<p>This time Gantry's smile was a grin of complete
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the way of it, eh? The Honorable
Senator took it out of your hands, did he? You'll
understand that I'm not casting any aspersions when
I say that it's exactly like him. If he has slated
you, you are booked to run; and if he runs you,
you'll be elected. Those are two of the things that
practically speak right out and say themselves here
in the old Sage-brush State."</p>

<p>Blount was indignant&#8212;justly indignant, he persuaded
himself.</p>

<p>"If that is the case, Gantry, it is high time that
some one should have nerve enough to break the
charm. I haven't said that I would accept the
nomination if it were tendered me, and I am not at
all sure that I am going to say it. And if I don't
say it, by all that's good and great, that settles it!"</p>

<p>Gantry was plainly shocked. "You're not trying
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>to make me believe that you've got nerve
enough to buck the old m&#8212;your father, I mean?
Why, great cats, Evan! you don't know what that
stands for in the greasewood hills!"</p>

<p>"And I don't care, Dick. Up to this present moment
I am a free moral agent; I haven't surrendered
any right of decision to my father, or to any one
else, so far as I am aware."</p>

<p>Gantry's eyes dropped to his plate, and his rejoinder
was not wholly free from guile.</p>

<p>"Will you authorize me to contradict the talk as
I can?" he asked, without looking up.</p>

<p>Blount was still warm enough to be peremptory.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may contradict it. You may say that
it is entirely unauthorized&#8212;that I have told you so
myself." Then he remembered the claims of friendship.
"I'll be frank with you, Dick; this thing has
been mentioned to me once, but nothing was decided&#8212;absolutely
nothing. I didn't even promise
to take it under advisement."</p>

<p>Among those who knew him only externally, Mr.
Richard Gantry had the reputation of owning a
loose tongue. But none recognized more justly t<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>han
the real Richard Gantry the precise instant at which
to bridle the loose tongue or when to make it wag
away from the subject which has reached its nicely
calculated climax. While the flush of irritation was
still making him ashamed that he had shown so
much warmth, Blount found himself gossiping with
his table companion over a social function two
days old; and subsequently, when the waiter brought
the cigars, Gantry was congratulating himself that
the danger-point, if any there were, was safely past.</p>

<p>It was after the club luncheon, and while the two
young men were on their way to the smoking-room,
that some one on business bent stopped Gantry in
the corridor. Blount strolled on by himself, and,
finding the smoking-room unoccupied, went to
lounge in a lazy-chair standing in a little alcove
lined with bookcases and half screened by the
racks of the newspaper files. Notwithstanding the
successful topic changing at table, he was still brooding
over the false position in which his father's plans
had placed him; wherefore he craved solitude and a
chance to think things over fairly and without heat.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Gantry looked in, and, apparently
missing the half-concealed easy-chair and its
occupant in the bookcase alcove, went his way. H<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>e
had scarcely had time to get out of the building, one
would say, before two men entered the smoking-room,
coming down the corridor from the grill.
Blount saw them, and he made sure that they saw
him. But when they had taken chairs on the other
side of the sheltering newspaper files he was suddenly
assured that they had not seen him. They
were talking quite freely of him and of his father.</p>

<p>"Well, the Honorable Dave has got McVickar
dead to rights this time," remarked the older of
the two, a hard-featured, round-bodied real-estate
promoter to whom Blount had been introduced on
his first day in the capital, but whose name he could
not now recall. "This scheme of the senator's for
shoving his son into the race for the attorney-generalship
is just about the foxiest thing he has
ever put across. You can bet the air was blue
in the Transcontinental Chicago offices when the
news got there."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose McVickar will do?" asked
the other.</p>

<p>"He will do anything the senator wants him to&#8212;he's
got to. Blount is land hungry, and I guess
he'll take a few more sections of the railroad mesa-land
under the Clearwater ditch. That was what
he did two years ago when McVickar wanted the
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>right of way for the branch through Carnadine
County."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe he's going to take any little
Christmas gift this time!" was the rasping reply.
"He'll sell the railroad something, and take good
hard money for it. It's a cinch. The railroad can't
afford to have the courts against it, and McVickar
will be made to sweat blood this heat. You watch
the wheels go round when McVickar comes out
here."</p>

<p>Evan Blount found himself growing strangely sick
and faint. Could it be his father whom they were
thus calmly accusing of graft and trickery and
blackmailing methods too despicable to be imagined?
His first impulse was to confront the two; to demand
proofs; to do and say what a loyal son should.
But the crushing conviction that they were discussing
only well-known and well-assured facts unnerved
him; and after that he was anxious for only
one thing&#8212;that they might finish their cigars and
go away without discovering him.</p>

<p>Fate was kind to him thus far. After a little
further talk, in which the accepted point of view of
the on looker at the great game was made still more
painfully evident for the unwilling listener, the men
went away. For a long time after they had gone,
Blount sat crumpled in the depths of the big chair,
chewing his extinct cigar and staring absently at the
row of books on a level with his eyes in the oppo<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>site
case.</p>

<p>One clear thought, and one only, came out of the
sorrowful confusion: not for any inducement that
could now be offered would he lend himself to the
furtherance of his father's plans. Beyond this he did
not reason in the miserable hour wrought out in the
quiet of the club smoking-room. But when he got
up to go, another prompting was forcing its way
to the surface&#8212;a prompting to throw himself boldly
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>into the scale against graft and chicanery; to redeem
at any cost, and by whatsoever means might
offer, the good old name which had been so shamefully
dragged in the mire.</p>

<p>He did not know just how it was to be done, but
he told himself that he would find a way. That
the path would be full of thorns he could not doubt,
since every step in it would widen the breach which
must be opened between his father and himself.
Possibly it might lead him to the bar of justice as
that father's accuser, but even in that hard case he
must not falter. He said to himself, in a fresh access
of passionate determination, that though he
might have to blush for his father, Patricia should
not be made ashamed for her lover.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the club, he paused long enough to
remember that he was in no fit frame of mind to
risk an immediate meeting with his father. To
make even a chance meeting impossible, he crossed
the street, and, passing through the Capitol grounds,
strolled aimlessly out one of the residence avenues
unt<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>il he came to the open country beyond the suburbs.</p>

<p>It was quite late in the afternoon when he re-entered
the city by another street and boarded a
trolley car for the down-town centre. The long afternoon
tramp, and the conclusions it had bred, made
it imperative for him to see Gantry before the traffic
manager should leave his office for the day. His
business with the railroad man was purely personal.
He meant to ask Gantry a few pointed questions
requiring such answers as friendship may demand.
If Gantry's replies were such as he feared they
would be, he would seek his father and come at once
to a plain understanding with him.</p>

<p>The trolley car dropped him within a square of
the railway station, on the second floor of which
Gantry had his business office. The shortest way
to the Sierra Avenue end of the station building
was through the great train-shed. Half-way up the
platform Blount met the west-bound Overland steaming
in from the eastern yards. At the Sierra Avenue
crossing the yard crew was cutting off a private car.
Blount saw the number on the medallion, "008,"
and noted half absently the rich window-hangings
and the polished brass platf<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>orm railings. A car inspector
in greasy overalls and jumper was tapping
the wheels with his long-handled hammer.</p>

<p>"Whose car is this?" asked Blount.</p>

<p>"'Tis Misther McVickar's, sorr&#8212;the vice-prisidint
av the coompany," said the man.</p>

<p>Blount turned away, saying something which the
hammer-man mistook for a word of thanks. So the
vice-president had come, hastening upon the wing
of occasions, it seemed. And in the light of the
overheard conversation in the club smoking-room,
it was only too easy to guess his errand in the Sage-brush
capital. He had come to make such terms as
he could with the man who was going to hold him up.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h3>A BATTLE ROYAL</h3>


<p>Having already convinced himself that the time
was ripe for a straightforward declaration of principles,
Evan Blount saw in the arrival of the Overland,
with the vice-president's private car attached,
only an added argument for haste.</p><p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></p>

<p>During the better part of the long tramp in the
outskirts of the city he had been halting between
two opinions. The fighting blood of the Tennessee
pioneer strain had clamored for its hearing, prompting
him to enter the lists, to set up the standard
of honesty and fair-dealing in the Blount name, to
plunge into the approaching political campaign with
a single purpose&#8212;the purpose of overthrowing the
power of the machine in his native State. On the
other hand, filial affection had pleaded eloquently.
The battle for political honesty would inevitably involve
his father; would, if successful, defeat and disgrace
him. As often as he thought he had closed
decisively with the idealistic determination, the other
side of the argument sprang up again, keen-edged
and biting. Up to the present moment he had owed
his father everything&#8212;was still owing him day by
day. Would it not be the part of a son to drop out
quietly, leaving the political house-cleaning for some
one who would not be obliged to pay such a costly
price?</p>

<p>It was the idealistic decision which had been in the
saddle when he dropped from the trolley car at the
western portal of the railway station, and which was
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>sending him to seek the scale-turning interview with
Gantry. But, after all, it was chance and the swift
current of events which seized upon him and swept
him along, smashing all the arguments and fine-spun
theories. Before he had gone ten steps in the
direction of Gantry's office, some one in the throng
of debarking Overland travellers called his name.
Turning quickly, he found himself face to face with
a white-haired little gentleman who had plucked impatiently
at his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Why, bless my soul! Of all the lucky miracles!"
gasped the young man who, but an instant earlier,
had been deaf and blind to all external things. And
then: "Where is Patricia?"</p>

<p>"She's here, somewhere," snapped the little gentleman
irascibly. "I've lost her in this confounded
mob. Find her for me. I've got my reading-glasses
on, and I can't see anything. Why don't they have
this barn of a place lighted up?"</p>

<p>"Stand still right where you are," Blount directed,
and a moment later he had found Patricia guarding
a pair of suit-cases which were too heavy for her to
carry.</p>

<p>"You poor lost child!" was his burbled greeting.</p>
<p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></p>
<p>"You don't mean to tell me that <i>this</i> is the West
to which you said you were coming?"</p>

<p>"I'm not lost; I'm here. It's father who is lost,"
she laughed. Then she answered his question;
"Yes, this is the West I meant, and if you haven't
been telling the truth about it&#8212;"</p>

<p>Blount had snatched up the two hand-bags and
had effected a reunion of the scattered pair. The
little gentleman, standing immovable, as he had
been told to do, was blinking impatiently through
his reading-glasses at the surging throng. When
Blount came up, the professor stabbed him with
a sharp forefinger.</p>

<p>"Well, we're here, young man," he barked. "If
you've been telling me fibs about those Megalosauridæ
which you said could be dug out of your sage-brush
hills, you'll pay our fare back home again&#8212;just
make up your mind to that. Now show us
the best hotel in this mushroom city of yours, and
do it quickly."</p>

<p>Having a hospitable thing to do, Blount shoved
his problem into a still more remote backgr<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>ound
and bestirred himself generously. Though the Inter-Mountain
was only three squares distant, he chartered
the best-looking auto he could find in the
rank of waiting vehicles, put his charges into it, and
went with them to do the honors at the hotel. By
this postponement of the visit to Gantry he missed
a meeting which would have done something toward
solving a part of his problem. But for the hospitable
turning aside he might have reached the railroad
office in time to see a round-bodied man halting at
the open door of Gantry's private room for a parting
word with the traffic manager.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he fell for it, all right," was the form
the parting word took. "If you had seen his face
when Lackner and I came away, you'd have said
there was battle, murder, and sudden death in it for
somebody."</p>

<p>"But, see here, Bradbury," Gantry held his visitor
to say, "it wasn't in the game that you were to fill
him up with a lot of lies. I won't stand for that,
you know. He is too good a fellow, and too good
a friend of mine."</p>

<p>It was at this conjuncture that Blount, if he had
been present and invisible, would have seen a sour
smile wrinkling upon the face of the club gossip.</p>

<p>"I owe the senator one or two on my own account,
Gantry. But it wasn't necessary to go out
of the beaten path. If young Blount or his daddy<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>
would like to sue us for libel, we could prove every
word that was said&#8212;or prove that it was common
report; too common to be doubted. And it got the
young fellow; got him right in the solar plexus. If
you don't see some fireworks within the next few
days, I miss my guess and lose my ante."</p>

<p>This is what Evan Blount, carrying out his intention
of going to Gantry, might have seen and heard.
On the other hand, if he had lingered a few minutes
longer on the station platform he could scarcely have
failed to mark the side-tracking of private car "008,"
and he might have seen the herculean figure of the
vice-president crossing to the carriage-stand to climb
heavily into a waiting automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. McVickar's order to the chauffeur was curtly
brief, and a little later the vice-president entered
the lobby of the Inter-Mountain and shot a brisk
question at the room-clerk.</p>

<p>"Is Senator Blount in his rooms?"</p>

<p>"I think not. He was here a few minutes ago.
I'll send a boy to hunt him up for you. You want
your usual suite, I suppose, Mr. McVickar?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm not stopping overnight. Is young<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
Blount here in the hotel?"</p>

<p>"He has just gone up to the fifth floor with some
friends of his&#8212;Mr. Anners and his daughter, from
Boston. Shall I hold him for you when he comes
down?"</p>

<p>"No; I want to see the senator. Hustle out another
boy or two. I can't wait all night."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Evan Blount, bearing
luggage-checks and going in search of the house
baggageman, missed another incident which might
have drawn him back suddenly to his problem and
its unsettled condition. The incident was the meeting
between his father and the railroad vice-president
at the room-clerk's counter. It was neither
hostile nor friendly; on McVickar's part it was
gruffly business-like.</p>

<p>"Well, Senator, I'm here," was the follow-up of
the perfunctory hand-shake. "Let's find a place
where we can flail it out," and together the two
entered an elevator.</p>

<p>Reaching the floor of the private dining-room<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>
suites, the ex-cattle-king led the way in silence to
his own apartments; rather let us say he pointed
the way, since in the march down the long corridor
the two field commanders tramped evenly abreast
as if neither would give the other the advantage
of an inch of precedence. In the sitting-room of
the private suite the senator snapped the latch on
the door, and pressed the wall-button for the electric
lights. McVickar dragged a chair over to one
of the windows commanding a view of the busy
street, and dropping solidly into it, like a man bracing
himself for a fight, began abruptly:</p>

<p>"I suppose we may as well cut out the preliminaries
and come to the point at once, Blount.
Ackerton wired me that you had definitely announced
your son as a candidate for the attorney-generalship.
Have you?"</p>

<p>The senator had found an unopened box of cigars
in a cabinet and he was inserting the blade of his
pocket-knife under the lid when he said, with good-natured
irony: "The primaries do the nominating
in this State, Hardwick. Didn't you know that?"</p>

<p>"See here, Blount; I've come half-way across the
continent to thresh this thin<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>g out with you, face to
face, and I'm not in the humor to spar for an opening.
Do you mean to run your son or not? That
is a plain question, and I'd like to have an equally
plain answer."</p>

<p>"I told you two weeks ago what you might expect
if you insisted on sticking your crow-bar in
among the wheels this fall, McVickar, but you
wouldn't believe me. I'll say it again if you want
to hear it."</p>

<p>"And I told you two weeks ago that we couldn't
stand for any such programme as the one you had
mapped out. And I added that you might name
your own price for an alternative which wouldn't
confiscate us and drive us off the face of the earth."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I named the price, if you happen to
remember."</p>

<p>"I know; you said you wanted us to turn everything
over to the Paramounters and take our chances
on a clean administration. Naturally, we're not
going to do any such Utopian thing as that. What
I want to know now is what it is going to cost us to
do the practical and possible thing."</p>
<p><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></p>
<p>"Want to buy me outright this time, do you,
Hardwick?" said the boss, still smiling.</p>

<p>"We"&#8212;McVickar was going to say&#8212;"We have
bought you before," but he changed the retort to
a less offensive phrasing&#8212;"We have had no difficulty
heretofore in arriving at some practical and
sensible <i>modus vivendi</i>, and we shouldn't have now.
But as a condition binding upon any sort of an
arrangement, I am here to say that we can't let you
nominate and elect your son as attorney-general;
that's out of the question. If it's going to prove
a personal disappointment to you, we'll be reasonable
and try to make it up to you in some other way."</p>

<p>Again the grimly humorous smile was twinkling
in the gray eyes of the old cattleman. "What is
the market quotation on disappointments, right
now, Hardwick?" he inquired.</p>

<p>With another man McVickar might have been
too diplomatic to show signs of a shortening temper.
But David Blount was an open-eyed enemy of long
standing.</p>

<p>"I don't know anybody west of the Missouri River
who has a better idea of market values than you
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>have," the vice-president countered smartly. Then,
dropping a heavy hand upon the arm of his chair:
"This thing has got to be settled here and now,
Blount. If you put your son in as public prosecutor,
you can have but one object in view&#8212;you
mean to squeeze us till the blood runs. We are
willing to discount that object before the fact!"</p>

<p>"So you have said before, a number of times and
in a whole heap of different ways. It's getting sort
of monotonous, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I sha'n't say it many more times, David; you
are pushing me too far and too hard."</p>

<p>"All right; what will you say, then?"</p>

<p>"Just this: if you won't meet me half-way&#8212;if
you insist upon a fight&#8212;I'll fight you with any
weapons I can get hold of!"</p>

<p>Once more the quiet smile played about the outer
angles of the hereditary Blount eyes.</p>

<p>"You've said that in other campaigns, Hardwick;
in the end you've always been like the 'possum that
offered to come down out of the tree if the man
wouldn't shoot."</p>

<p>"I'll hand you another proverb to go with that
one," snapped the man in the arm-chair: "The
pitcher that goes once too often to the well is sure
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>to be broken. You've got a joint in your armor
now, Blount. You've always been able to snap
your fingers at public opinion before this; can you
afford to do it now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; I reckon I'll have to grin
and bear it if you want to buy up a few newspapers
and set them to blacklisting me, as you usually do,"
was the half-quizzical reply. Then: "I'm pretty
well used to it by this time. You and your folks
can't paint me much blacker than you have always
painted me, Hardwick."</p>

<p>"Maybe not. But this time we're going to give
you a chance to start a few libel suits&#8212;if you think
you can afford to appear in the courts. We've got
plenty of evidence, and by heavens we'll produce
it! You put your son in as public prosecutor and
we might be tempted to make your own State too
hot to hold you. Had you thought of that?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead and try it," was the laconic response.</p>

<p>"But that isn't all," the railroad dictator went
on remorselessly. "Your fellow citizens here know
you for exactly what you are, Blount. You rule them
with a rod of iron, but that rule can be broken.
When it is broken, you'll be hounded as a criminal.
In our last talk together you had something to say
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>to me about our not keeping up with the change in
public sentiment; public sentiment <i>has</i> changed;
changed so far that it is coming to demand the
punishment of the great offenders as well as the jailing
of the little ones. If we want to push this fight
hard enough, it is not impossible that you might find
yourself in a hard row of stumps at the end of it,
David."</p>

<p>"I'm taking all those chances," was the even-toned
rejoinder of the man who was to be shown up.</p>

<p>"But there is one chance I'm sure you haven't
considered," McVickar went on aggressively. "This
son of yours; I know as much about him as you do&#8212;more,
perhaps, for I have taken more pains to
keep tab on him for the past few years than you
have. He is clean and straight, Blount; a son for
any father to be proud of. If that is the real reason
why we don't want to have him instructing the
grand juries of this State, it is also your best reason
for wanting to keep the past decently under cover.
What will you say to him when the newspapers open
up on you? And what will he say to you? And
suppose you get him in, and we should show you up
so that you'd be dragged into court with your own
son for the prosecutor? How does that strike you?"</p>

<p>For the first time since the opening of the one-sided
conference the senator laid his cigar aside<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>
and sat thoughtfully tugging at the drooping mustaches.</p>

<p>"You'd set the house afire over my head, would
you, Hardwick?" he queried, with the gray eyes
lighting up as with a glow of smouldering embers.
"The last time we talked you'll remember that you
posted your 'de-fi'; now I'll post mine. You go
ahead and do your damnedest! The boy and I will
try to see to it that you don't have all the fun. I
won't say that you mightn't turn him if you went
at it right; but you won't go at it right, and as
matters stand now&#8212;well, blood is thicker than
water, Hardwick, and if you hit me you hit him.
I reckon, between us, we'll make out to give you
as good as you send. That's all"&#8212;he rose to lean
heavily upon the table&#8212;"all but one thing: you
fight fair, Hardwick; say anything you like about
me and I'll stand for it; but if that boy has anything
in his past that I don't know about&#8212;any little
fool trick that he wouldn't want to see published&#8212;you
let it alone and keep your damned newspaper
hounds off of it!"</p>

<p>The vice-president, being of those who regain
equanimity in exact proportion as an opponent loses
it, chuckled grimly; was still chuckling when an interrupting
tap came at the locked door. Blount
got up and turned the latch to admit an office-boy
wearing the uniform of the railroad headquarters.
"Note for Mr. McVickar," said the messenger; and
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>at a gesture from the senator he crossed the room
to deliver it.</p>

<p>For a full half-minute after the boy had gone, the
vice-president sat poring over the pencilled scrawl,
which was all that the sealed envelope yielded. The
note was lacking both date-line and signature, though
the clerks in Richard Gantry's office were familiar
enough with the hieroglyph that appeared at the
bottom of the sheet. In his own good time the
vice-president folded the bit of paper and thrust it
into his pocket. Then he resumed the talk at the
precise point at which it had been broken off.</p>

<p>"You needn't let the boy's record trouble you,"
he averred. "As I said a few minutes ago, it's as
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>clean as a hound's tooth. That is one of the things
I'm banking on, David. If you don't look out,
I'm going to have that young fellow fighting on our
side before we're through."</p>

<p>At this the light in the gray eyes flamed fiercely,
and the ex-cattle-king took the two strides needful
to place him before McVickar.</p>

<p>"Don't you try that, McVickar; I give you fair
warning!" he grated, his deep-toned voice rumbling
like the burr of grinding wheels. "There's only one
way you could do it, and&#8212;"</p>

<p>The vice-president stood up and reached for his
hat.</p>

<p>"And you'll take precious good care that I
don't get a chance to try that way, you were going
to say. All right, David; you tell me to do my
damnedest, and I'll hand <i>that</i> back to you, too.
You do the same, and we'll see who comes out<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>
ahead."</p>

<p>The vice-president caught an elevator at the end
of his leisurely progress down the corridor, and had
himself lowered to the lobby. The electric lights
were glowing, and the great gathering-place was
beginning to take on its evening stir. Mr. Hardwick
McVickar pushed his way to the desk, and a
row of lately arrived guests waited while he asked
his question.</p>

<p>"Where shall I be most likely to find Mr. Evan
Blount at this time of day?" he demanded; and the
obliging clerk made the guest-line wait still longer
while he summoned a bell-boy and sent him scurrying
over to one of the writing-tables.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Evan Blount," said the clerk, indicating
the young man who came up with the returning
bell-boy. "Mr. Blount, this is Mr. Hardwick
McVickar, first vice-president of the Transcontinental
Railway Company."</p>

<p>There was no trace of the recent battle in Mr.
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>McVickar's voice or manner when he shook hands
cordially with the son of the man who had so lately
defied him.</p>

<p>"Your father and I were just now holding a little
conference over your future prospects, Mr. Blount,"
he said, going straight to his point. "Suppose you
come down to the car with me for a private talk on
legal matters. I'm inclined to think that we shall
wish to retain you in a cause which is coming up in
September. Gantry tells me that you are pretty
well up in corporation law. Can you spare me a
half-hour or so?"</p>

<p>Evan Blount glanced at the big clock over the
clerk's head. Patricia had told him that she and
her father would dine in the <i>café</i> at seven, and that
there would be a place at their table for him&#8212;and
another for his father, if the ex-senator would so far
honor a poor college professor. There was an hour
to spare; and if the vice-president of the Transcontinental
was not the king, he was at least a great
man, and one whose invitation was in some sense
a royal command.</p>
<p><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></p>
<p>"Certainly, I'll be glad to go with you," was
Blount's acquiescent rejoinder. So much the registry-clerk
heard; and he saw, between jabs with his
pen, the straight path to the revolving doors of the
portal ploughed by the big man with young Blount
at his elbow.</p>

<p>One minute after the spinning doors had engulfed
the pair the registry-clerk was called on the house
telephone. A sad-faced tourist who was waiting
patiently for his room assignment heard only the
answer to the question which came over the wire
from one of the upper floors: "No, Senator, Mr.
Evan is not here; he has just this moment gone
out&#8212;with Mr. McVickar. Could I overtake him?
I'll try; but I don't know where they were going.
Yes; all right. I'll send a boy right away."</p>

<h3>THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT</h3>

<p><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>
<p>When the news went forth to the dwellers in the
sage-brush hills that Boss David's son had been
appointed to fill an important office as a member
of the railroad company's legal staff, the first
wave of astoundment was swiftly followed by many
speculations as to what young Blount's <i>début</i> as a
railroad placeman really meant.</p>

<p><i>The Plainsman</i>, the capital city's principal daily,
and the outspoken organ of the people's party, was
quick to discover an ulterior motive in Evan Blount's
appointment and its acceptance. Blenkinsop, the
leader-writer on <i>The Plainsman</i>, took a half-column
in which to point out in emphatic and vigorous
Western phrase the dangers that threatened the
commonwealth in this very evident coalition of the
railroad octopus and the machine.</p>

<p>The <i>Lost River Miner</i>, on the contrary, was unwilling
to believe that the younger Blount was acting
in the interest of machine politics in taking an employee's
place on the railroad pay-roll. In this
editor's comment there were veiled hints of a disagreement
between father and son; of differences
of opinion which might, later on, lead to a pitched
battle. The <i>Capital Daily</i>, however&#8212;the stock in
which was said to be owned or controlled by local
railroad officials&#8212;took a different ground, covertly
insinuating that nothing for nothing was the accepted
rule in politics; that if th<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>e railroad company had
made a place for the son, it was only a justifiable
deduction that the father was not as fiercely inimical
to the railroad interests as the opposition press
was willing to have a too credulous public believe.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the State press comment was divided,
as the moulders of public opinion happened
to read party loss or gain in the appointment of the
new legal department head. Some were fair enough
to say that young Blount had merely shown good
sense in taking the first job that was offered him,
following the commendation with the very obvious
conclusion that the railroad company's pay check
would buy just as much bread in the open market
as anybody's else. On the whole, the senator's son
was given the benefit of the doubt and a chance to
prove up.</p>

<p>Of the interview between the father and the son,
in which Evan announced his intention of accepting
a place under McVickar, nothing was said in
the newspapers, for the very good reason that no
reporter was present. If the young man who had
so summarily taken his future into his own hands
was anticipating a storm of disapproval and opposition,
he was disappointed. He had seen Mr. McVickar's
private car coupled to the east-bound Fast</p>

<p>Mail, and had dined with Patricia and her father,
the fourth seat at the table of reunion being vacant
because the senator was dining elsewhere. Later in
the evening he faced the music in the sitting-room
of the private suite, waylaying his father on the
Honorable David's return to the hotel.</p>

<p>Planning it out beforehand, Blount had meant to
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>give the ethical reasons which had constrained him
to put a conclusive end to the attorney-generalship
scheme. But when the crux came, the carefully
planned argument side-stepped and he was reduced
to the necessity of declaring his purpose baldly. The
railroad people had offered him a place, and he had
accepted it.</p>

<p>"So McVickar talked you over to his side, did
he?" was the boss's gentle comment. "It's all
right, son; you're a man grown, and I reckon you
know best what you want to do. If it puts us on
opposite sides of the political creek, we won't let
that roil the water any more than it has to, will we?"</p>

<p>To such a mild-mannered surrender, or apparent
surrender, the stirring filial emotions could do no
less than to respond heartily.</p>

<p>"We mustn't let it," was the quick reply; but after
this the younger man added: "I feel that I ought to
make some explanations&#8212;they're due to you. I've
been knocking about here in the city with my eyes
and ears open, and I must confess that the political
field has been made to appear decidedly unattractive
to me. From all I can learn, the political situation
in the State is handled as a purely business
proposition; it is a matter of bargain and sale. I
couldn't go into anything like that and keep my
self-respect."</p>

<p>"No, of course you couldn't, son. So you just
took a<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a> job where you could earn good, clean money
in your profession. I don't blame you a particle."</p>

<p>Blount was vaguely perturbed, and he showed it
by absently laying aside the cigar which he had
lately lighted and taking a fresh one from the open
box on the table. He could not help the feeling
that he ought to be reading between the lines in the
paternal surrender.</p>

<p>"You think there will be more or less political
work in my job with the railroad?" he suggested,
determined to get at the submerged facts, if there
were any.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; you say McVickar has hired
you to do a lawyer's work, and I reckon that is what
he will expect you to do, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Blount laid the second cigar aside and crossed the
room to readjust a half-opened ventilating transom.
Mr. McVickar had not defined the duties of the new
counselship very clearly, but there had been a strong
inference running through the private-car conference
to the effect that the headship of the local
legal department would carry with it some political
responsibilities. At the moment the newly appointed
placeman had been rather glad that such
was the case. The vice-president had convinced
him of the justice of the railroad company's contention&#8212;namely,
that the present laws of the</p>

<p>State, if rigidly administered, amounted to a p<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>ractical
confiscation of the company's property. While
Mr. McVickar was talking, Blount had hoped that
the new office which the vice-president was apparently
creating for him would give him a free hand
to place the company's point of view fairly before
the people of the State, and to do this he knew he
would have to enter the campaign in some sort as a
political worker. Surely, his father must know this;
and he went boldly upon the assumption that his
father did know it.</p>

<p>"As I have said, I am to be chief of the legal department
on this division, and as such it will be
necessary for me to defend my client both in court
and out of court," he said finally. "Since I am
fairly committed, I shall try to stay on the job."</p>

<p>"Of course you will. You've got to be honest
with yourself&#8212;and with McVickar. I don't mind
telling you, son, that I'm flat-footed on the other
side this time, and I had hoped you were going to
be. But if you're not, why, that's the end of it.
We won't quarrel about it."</p>

<p>Now this was not at all the paternal attitude as
the young man had been prefiguring it. He had
looked for opposition; finding it, he would have
found it possibl<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>e to say some of the things which
were crying to be said and which still remained
unsaid. But there was absolutely no loophole
through which he could force the attack. If his
late decision had been of no more importance than
the breaking of a dinner engagement, his father
could scarcely have dismissed it with less apparent
concern. Balked and practically talked to a standstill
in the business matter, Blount switched to
other things.</p>
<p><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></p>
<p>"I missed you to-night at dinner," he said, beginning
on the new tack. "Two of my Cambridge
friends are here, and I wanted you to meet them."</p>

<p>The Honorable David looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"The fossil-digging professor and his daughter?"
he queried shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Yes; how did you know? They came in on the
Overland, and I find that the professor has made the
long journey on the strength of what I once told
him about the megatheriums and things. I guess
it's up to me to make good in some way."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry a minute about that, Evan,
boy," was the instant rejoinder. "Honoria's coming
in from Wartrace to-morrow, and if you'll put
us next, we'll take care of your friends&#8212;mighty
good care of 'em." Then, almost wistfully Blount
thought: "You won't mind letting Honoria do that
much for you, will you, son?"</p>

<p>"I'd be a cad i<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>f I did. And you've taken a load
off of my shoulders, I can assure you. If you can
persuade Mrs. Blount into it, I'll arrange for a little
dinner of five to-morrow evening in the <i>café</i> where
we can all get together. You'll like the professor,
I know; and I hope you're going to like Patricia.
She's New England, and at first you may think she's
a bit chilly. But really she isn't anything of the
kind."</p>

<p>The Honorable Senator got up and strolled to the
window.</p>

<p>"You'd better go to bed, son," he advised. "It's
getting to be mighty late, and you'll want to be
surging around some with these friends of yours to-morrow.
And, before I forget it, the big car is in
Heffelfinger's garage. Order it out after breakfast
and show the Cambridge folks a good time."</p>

<p>It was late the following evening, several hours
after the informal little dinner for five in the Inter-Mountain
<i>café</i>, when the senator had himself lifted
from the lobby to the private-suite floor and made
his way to <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>the door of his own apartments. As was
her custom when they were together, his wife was
waiting up for him.</p>

<p>"Did you find out anything more?" she asked,
without looking up from the tiny embroidery frame
which was her leisure-filling companion at home or
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Not enough to hurt anything. McVickar has
fixed things to suit himself. The boy's law-office
job is to be pretty largely nominal; a sort of go-as-you-please
and do-as-you-like proposition on the
side, with Ackerton to do all the sure-enough court
work and legal drudgery. Since Ackerton is a pretty
clean fellow, and Evan stands up so straight that
he leans over backward, this lay-out means that
the bribing isn't going to be done by the legal department
in the coming campaign."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"All but one little thing. Evan's job is to be
more or less associated with the traffic department,
and the word has been passed to Gantry and his
crowd to see to it that the boy doesn't get to know
too much."</p><p><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></p>

<p>"But they can't keep him from finding out about
the underground work!" protested the small one.</p>

<p>"If it's an order from headquarters, they're going
to try mighty hard. Evan wants to believe that
everything is on the high moral plane, and when a
man wants to believe a thing it isn't so awfully
hard to fool him. It'll be a winning card for them
if they can send the boy out to talk convincingly
about the cleanness of the company's campaign.
That sort of talk, handed out as Evan can hand it,
if he is convinced of the truth of what he is saying,
will capture the honest voter every time. I tell
you, little woman, there's a thing we politicians are
constantly losing sight of: that down at the bedrock
bottom the American voter&#8212;'the man in the
street,' as the newspapers call him&#8212;is a fair man
and an honest man. Speaking broadly, you couldn't
buy him with a clear title to a quarter-section in
Paradise."</p>

<p>This little eulogy upon the American voter appeared
to be wasted upon the small person in the
wicker rocking-chair. "We must get him back,"
she remarked, referring, not to the American voter,<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>
but to the senator's son. "Have you thought of
any plan?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him sweetly. "You are like the
good doctor who cannot prescribe for the members
of his own family. If he were anybody else's son,
you would know exactly what to do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should."</p>

<p>"I have a plan," she went on quietly, bending
again over her embroidery. "He may have to take
a regular course of treatment, and it may make him
very ill; would you mind that?"</p>

<p>David Blount leaned back in his chair and regarded
her through half-closed eyelids. "You're
a wonder, little woman," he said; and then: "I
don't want to see the boy suffer any more than he
has to."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," was the swift agreement. Then,
with no apparent relevance: "What do you think
of Miss Anners?"</p>

<p>The senator sat up at the question, with the slow
smile wrinkling humorously at the corners of his
eyes.</p>
<p><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></p>
<p>"I haven't thought much about her yet. She's
the kind that won't let you get near enough in
a single sitting to think much about her, isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"She is a young woman with an exceedingly
bright mind and a very high purpose," was the
little lady's summing-up of Patricia. "But she isn't
altogether a Boston iceberg. She thinks she is irrevocably
in love with her chosen career; but, really,
I believe she is very much in love with Evan. If
we could manage to win her over to our side as an
active ally&#8212;"</p>

<p>This time the senator's smile broadened into a
laugh.</p>

<p>"You are away yonder out of my depth now,"
he chuckled. "Does your course of treatment for
the boy include large doses of the young woman,
administered frequently?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," was the instant reply. "I was only
wondering if it wouldn't be well to enroll her&#8212;enlist
her sympathies, you know."</p>

<p>"Why not?&#8212;if you think best? You're the fine-haired
little wire-puller, and it's all in your hands."</p><p><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></p>

<p>"Will you give me <i>carte-blanche</i> to do as I please?"
asked the small plotter.</p>

<p>"Sure!" said the Honorable David heartily, adding:
"You can always outfigure me, two to one,
when it comes to the real thing. You've made a
fine art of it, Honoria, and I'll turn the steering-wheel
over to you any day in the week."</p>

<p>When she looked up she was smiling in the way
which had made Evan Blount wonder, in that midnight
meeting at Wartrace Hall, how she could look
so young and yet be so wise.</p>

<p>"You deal with people in the mass, David, and
no one living can do it better. I am like most
women, I think: I deal with the individual. That
is all the difference. When do the Annerses go out
to the fossil-beds?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; any time when you will invite
them to make Wartrace their headquarters, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"Then I think it will be to-morrow," decided the
confident mistress of policies. "It won't do to let
Evan see too much of Patricia until after his course
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>of treatment is well under way. Shall we make it
to-morrow? And will you telephone Dawkins to
bring down the biggest car? I have a notion wandering
around in my head somewhere that Miss
Patricia Anners will stand a little judicious impressing.
She is exceedingly democratic, you know&#8212;in
theory."</p>

<h3>THE RANK AND FILE</h3>


<p>Considerably to his surprise, and no less to his
satisfaction, the newly appointed "division counsel,"
as his title ran, was not required to take over
the old legal department offices in the second story
of the station building, where all the other offices of
the company were located. Instead, he was directed
to fit up a suite of rooms in Temple Court, the capital's
most pretentious up-town sky-scraper, and there
was something more than a hint that the item of
first cost would not be too closely scrutinized.</p>

<p>It was the vice-president himself, writing from
Chicago, who authorized the new departure and
loosened the purse strings. "Don't be afraid of
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>spending a little money," wrote the great man.
"Make your up-town headquarters as attractive as
may be, and arrange matters with Ackerton so that
your office will not be burdened with too much of
the routine legal work. A successful legal representative
will be a good mixer&#8212;as I am sure you are&#8212;and
will extend the circle of his acquaintance as
rapidly and as far as possible. Your appointment
will be fully justified when you have made your
up-town office a place where the good citizens of
the capital and the State can drop in for a cordial
word with the company's spokesman."</p>

<p>Acting upon this suggestion, Blount opened the
Temple Court headquarters at once and threw himself
energetically into the indicated field. Ackerton,
a technical expert with a needle-like mind and
the State code at his fingers'-ends, was left in charge
of the working offices in the railroad building, with
instructions to apply to his chief only when he needed
specific advice.</p>

<p>At the up-town headquarters, Blount gave himself
wholly to the pleasant task of making friends.
With a good store of introductions upon which to
make a beginning, and with the open-handed, whole-souled
<i>camaraderie</i> of the West to help, the list of
acquaintances grew with amazing rapidity. For<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
the three or four weeks after Mrs. Blount had
whisked the Annerses away to Wartrace Hall and
the habitat of the Megalosauridæ, the newly appointed
"social secretary" for the railroad, as Honoria
had dubbed him, met all comers joyously and
accepted all invitations, never inquiring whether
they were extended to his father's son, to the railroad
company's legal chief, or to Evan Blount in
his proper person.</p>

<p>During this social interval he saw little of his
father, though he was still occupying his share of
the private dining-room suite at the Inter-Mountain.
Part of the time, as he knew, the Honorable Senator
was at Wartrace Hall, looking after his mammoth
ranch, and helping to entertain the visitors from</p>

<p>Massachusetts. But now and again the father came
and went; and occasionally there was a dinner <i>à
deux</i> in the hotel <i>café</i>, with a little good-natured
raillery from the senator's side of the table.</p>

<p>"Got you chasing your feet right lively in the
social merry-go-round these days, haven't they,
son? Like it, as far as you've gone?" said the ex-cattle-king
one evening when Evan had come down
in evening clothes, ready to go to madam the
governor's wife's strictly formal "informal" a little
later on.</p>

<p>"It's all in the day's work," laughed the younger
man. "I shall need all the 'pull' I can get a little
later on, sha'n't I?"</p><p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if you did, son; I shouldn't
wonder if you did. And I reckon you're doing
pretty good work, too, mixing and mingling the
way you do. Was it McVickar's idea, or your own&#8212;this
sudden splash into the social water-hole?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you that it is a part of the
new policy," returned the social splasher, still smiling.
"We are out to make friends this time; good,
solid, open-eyed friends who will know just what
we are doing and why we are doing it."</p>

<p>"H'm," mused the senator, "so publicity's the
new word, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; publicity is the word. The Gordon people
say they are going to show us up; there won't be
anything to show up when the time comes. We
are going to beat them to the billboards."</p>

<p>The grizzled veteran of a goodly number of political
battles put down his coffee-cup; he was
still old-fashioned enough to drink his coffee in
generous measure with the meat courses.</p>

<p>"You can't do the circus act&#8212;ride<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a> two horses at
once and do the same stunt on both, son," he
remarked gravely. "If you're really going to put
the saddle and bridle on the publicity nag, you've
got to turn the other one out of the corral and let
it go back to the short-grass."</p>

<p>"It is already turned out," asserted the young
man, not affecting to misunderstand. "We neither
buy votes nor spend illegitimate money in this
campaign."</p>

<p>The stout assertion was good as far as it went;
the new division counsel made it and believed it. But
on his way to the governor's mansion, a little later,
he could not help wondering if he had been altogether
candid in making it. The offices in the up-town
sky-scraper were not exclusively a railroad social
centre where the disinterested voter could come and
have the facts ladled out to him without fear or
favor on the part of the ladler. They had come to
be also a rallying-point for a heterogeneous crowd
of ward-workers, wire-pullers, and small politicians,
most of whom were anxious to be employed or retained
as henchmen. Some of these "stretcher men,"
as Blount contemptuously called them, had been
employed in past campaigns; others were still the
beneficiaries of the railroad, holding pay-roll places
which Blount acutely suspected were chiefly sinecures.</p>
<p><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></p>
<p>Latterly, this contingent of strikers and heelers
had been greatly augmented, and it was beginning
to make its demands more emphatic. A dozen
times a day Blount had the worn phrase, "nothing
for nothing," dinned into his ears, and he was beginning
to harbor a suspicion that his office had
been made a dumping-ground for all the other
departments.</p>

<p>Seeing Gantry at madam the governor's lady's
reception, Blount took an early opportunity of cornering
the traffic manager in one of the otherwise
deserted smoking-dens, and when he had made sure
there were no eavesdroppers plunged at once into
the middle of things.</p>

<p>"See here, Dick," he began, "you fellows downtown
are making my office a cesspool, and I won't
stand for it. Garrigan, that saloon-keeper in the
second ward, came up to-day to ask for a free ticket
to Worthington and return; and when I pinned him
down he admitted that you'd sent him to me."</p>

<p>"I did," said Gantry, grinning. "Why otherwise
have we got a post-graduate, double-certificated
political manager, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>Blount dropped into a chair and felt in his pockets
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>for his cigar-case.</p>

<p>"I guess we may as well fight this thing to a
finish right here and now, Dick," he said coolly.
"I'm not chief vote buyer for the Transcontinental
Company&#8212;I'm not any kind of a vote buyer."</p>

<p>"Who said you were?" retorted the traffic manager.</p>

<p>"It says itself, if I am supposed to cut the pie
and hand out pieces of it to these grub-stakers that
you and Carson and Bentley and Kittredge are
continually sending to me."</p>

<p>This time Gantry's grin was playful, but behind
it there was a shrewd flash of the Irish-blue eyes
that Blount did not see.</p>

<p>"I guess the company would be plenty willing to
furnish a few small pies for really hungry people,
if you think you need them to go along with your
Temple Court office fittings," he returned.</p>

<p>"Ah?" said Blount calmly, giving the exclamation
the true Boston inflection. "You are either
too shrewd or not quite shrewd enough, Dick. You<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
covered that up with a laugh, so that I might take
it as a joke if I happened to be too thin-skinned to
take it in disreputable earnest. Let us understand
each other; we are fighting squarely in the open
in this campaign; publicity is the word&#8212;I have Mr.
McVickar for my authority. Anybody who wants
to know anything about the railroad company's
business in this State can learn it for the asking,
and at first-hand. Secrecy and all the various
brands of political claptrap that have been
admitted in the past are to be shown the door. This
is the intimation that was made to me: wasn't it
made to you?"</p>

<p>Gantry did not reply directly to the direct demand.
On the other hand, he very carefully refrained
from answering it in any degree whatsoever.</p>

<p>"You have your job to hold down and I have
mine," he rejoined. "What you say goes as it
lies, of course; but just the same, I shouldn't be
too righteously hard on the little brothers, if I were
you."</p>

<p>"If by the 'little brothers' you mean the pie-eaters,
I'm going to fire them out, neck and crop,
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>Richard. They make me excessively weary."</p>

<p>Gantry's playful mood fell away from him like a
cast-off garment.</p>

<p>"I don't quite believe I'd do that, if I were you,
Evan. There are pie-eaters on both sides in every
political contest, and while they can't do any cause
any great amount of good, they can often do a good
bit of harm. I wouldn't be too hard on them, if I
were you."</p>

<p>"What would you do?&#8212;or, rather, what did you
do when you were managing the State campaign
two years ago?" inquired Blount pointedly.</p>

<p>"I cut the pie," said the traffic manager simply.</p>

<p>"In other words, you let this riffraff blackmail
you and, incidentally, put a big black mark against
the company's good name."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I wouldn't put it quite that strong.
Not many of these little fellows ask for money, or
expect it. A free ride now and then in the varnished
cars is about all they look for."</p>

<p>"But you can't give them passes under the interstate
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>law," protested the purist.</p>

<p>"Not outside of the State, of course. But inside
of the State boundaries it's our own business."</p>

<p>"You mean it <i>was</i> our own business, previous to
the passage of the State rate law two years ago,"
corrected Blount.</p>

<p>"It is our own business to this good day&#8212;in effect.
That part of the law has been a complete dead-letter
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>from the day the governor signed it. Why,
bless your innocent heart, Evan, the very men who
argued the loudest and voted the most spitefully for
it came to me for their return tickets home at the
end of the session. Of course, we kept the letter
of the law. It says that no 'free passes' shall be
given. We didn't issue passes; we merely gave
them tickets out of the case and charged them up
to 'expense.'"</p>

<p>"Faugh!" said Blount, "you make me sick!
Gantry, it's that same childish whipping of the devil
around the stump by the corporations&#8212;an expedient
that wouldn't deceive the most ignorant voter
that ever cast a ballot&#8212;it's that very thing that
has stirred the whole nation up to this unreasonable
fight against corporate capital. Don't you see it?"</p>

<p>Gantry shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I guess I take the line of the least resistance&#8212;like
the majority of them," was the colorless reply.
"When it comes down to practical politics&#8212;"</p>

<p><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>"Don't say 'practical politics' to me, Dick!"
rasped the reformer. "We've got the strongest argument
in the world in the fact that the present
law is an unfair one, needing modification or repeal.
We mustn't spoil that argument by becoming law-breakers
ourselves and descending to the methods
of the grafters and the machine politicians the
country over. If you have been sending these pie-eaters
to me, stop it&#8212;don't do it any more. I have
no earthly use for them; and they won't have any
use for me after I open up on them and tell them
a few things they don't seem to know, or to care
to know."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I'd do anything brash," Gantry
suggested mildly, and he was still saying the same
thing in diversified forms when Blount led the way
back to the crowded drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>Dating from this little heart-to-heart talk with
the traffic manager, Blount began to carry out the
new policy&#8212;the starvation policy, as it soon came
to be known among the would-be henchmen. The
result was not altogether reassuring. The first few
rebuffs he administered left him with the feeling that
he was winning Pyrrhic victories; it was as if he
were trying to handle a complicated mechanism with
the working details of which he was only theoretically
familiar. There were wheels within wheels,
and the application of the brakes to the smallest
of them led to discordant janglings throughout the
whole.</p>

<p>Many of the small grafters were on the pay-rolls
of the railroad company, and Blount was soon definitely
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>assured of what he had before only suspected&#8212;that
they were merely nominal employees given
a pay-roll standing so that there might be an excuse
for giving them free transportation, and a retainer
in the form of wages, if needful.</p>

<p>In many cases the ramifications of the petty graft
were exasperatingly intricate. For example: one
Thomas Gryson, who was on the pay-rolls as a
machinist's helper in the repair shops, demanded
free transportation across the State for eight members
of his "family." Questioned closely, he admitted
that the "family" was his only by a figure
of speech; that the relationship was entirely political.
Blount promptly refused to recommend the
issuing of employees' passes for the eight, and the
result was an immediate call from Bentley, the division
master mechanic.</p>

<p>"About that fellow Gryson," Bentley began;
"can't you manage some way to get him transportation
for his Jonesboro crowd? He is going to
make trouble for us if you don't."</p>

<p>Blount was justly indignant. "Gryson is on your
pay-roll," he retorted. "Why don't you recommend
the passes yourself, on account of the motive-power
department, if he is entitled to them?"</p>

<p>"I can't," admitted the master mechanic. "I am
held down to the issuing of passes to employees travelling
on company business only. We can stretch <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>it
a little sometimes, of course, but we can't make it
cover the whole earth."</p>

<p>"Neither can I!" Blount exploded. "Let it be
understood, once for all, Mr. Bentley, that I am
not the scape-goat for all the other departments! I
have cut it off short; I am not recommending
passes for anybody."</p>

<p>"But, suffering Scott, Mr. Blount, we've simply
<i>got</i> to take care of Tom Gryson! He's the boss of
his ward, and he has influence enough to turn even
our own employees against us!"</p>

<p>"Influence?" scoffed the young man from the
East. "How does he acquire his influence? It is
merely another illustration of the vicious circle;
you put into his hands the club with which he
proceeds to knock you down. Let me tell you what
I'm telling everybody; if we want a square deal,
we've got to set the example by being square. And,
by Heavens, Mr. Bentley, we're going to set the
example!"</p>

<p>The master mechanic went away silenced, but by<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>
no means convinced; and a week later Gryson, who
in appearance was a typical tough, and who in reality
was a post-graduate of the hard school of violence
and ruffianage obtaining in the lawless mining-camps
of the Carnadine Hills, sauntered into Blount's
office with his cigar at the belligerent angle and an
insolent taunt in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Well, pardner, we got them dickie-birds o' mine
over to Jonesboro, after so long a time, and no
thanks to you, neither. I just blew in to tell you
that I'm goin' to hit you ag'in about day after to-morrow,
and if you don't come across there's goin'
to be somethin' doin'; see?"</p>

<p>Blount sprang from his chair and forgot to be
politic.</p>

<p>"You needn't come to me the day after to-morrow,
or any other time," he raged. "I'm through with
you and your tribe. Get out!"</p>

<p>After Gryson, muttering threats, had gone, the
young campaign manager had an attack of moral
nausea. It seemed such a prodigiou<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>s waste of time
and energy to traffic and chaffer with these petty
scoundrels. Thus far, every phase of the actual
political problem seemed to be meanly degrading,
and he was beginning to long keenly for an opportunity
to do some really worthy thing.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, his ideals were still unshaken.
He still clung to the belief that the corporation,
which was created by the law and could exist only
under the protection of the law, must, of necessity,
be a law-abiding entity. It was manifestly unfair
to hold it responsible for the disreputable political
methods of those whom it could never completely
control&#8212;methods, too, which had been forced upon
it by the necessity, or the fancied necessity, of meeting
conditions as they were found.</p>

<p>As if in answer to the wish that he might find the
worthier task, it was on this day of Gryson's visit
that Blount was given his first opportunity of entering
the wider field. A letter from a local party
chairman in a distant mining town brought an invitation
of the kind for which he had been waiting
and hoping. He was asked to participate in a joint
debate at the campaign opening in the town in
question, and he was s<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>o glad of the chance that he
instantly wired his acceptance.</p>

<p>That evening, at the Inter-Mountain <i>café</i> dinner
hour, he found his father dining alone and joined
him. In a burst of confidence he told of the invitation.</p>

<p>"That's good; that's the real thing this time,
isn't it?" was the senator's even-toned comment.
"Gives you a right nice little chance to shine the
way you can shine best." Then: "That was one
of the things McVickar wanted you for, wasn't it?&#8212;speech-making
and the like?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; he intimated that there might be
some public speaking," admitted the younger man.</p>

<p>"Well, what-all are you going to tell these Ophir
fellows when you get over there, son?" asked the
veteran quizzically. "Going to offer 'em all free
passes anywhere they want to go if they'll promise
to vote for the railroad candidates?"</p>

<p>"Not this year," was the laughing reply. "As
I told you a while back, we've stopped all that."</p>

<p>"You have, eh? I reckon that will be mighty
sorry news for a good many people in the old Sage-brush
State&#8212;mighty sorry news. You really reckon<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
you <i>have</i> stopped it, do you, son?"</p>

<p>"I not only believe it; I am in a position to assert
it definitely."</p>

<p>"McVickar has told you it was stopped?"</p>

<p>The newly fledged political manager tried to be
strictly truthful.</p>

<p>"I have had but the one interview with Mr. McVickar,
but in that talk he gave me to understand
that my recommendations would be given due consideration.
And I have said my say pretty emphatically."</p>

<p>The senator's smile was not derisive; it was merely
lenient.</p>

<p>"Sat on 'em good and hard, did you? That's
right, son; don't you ever be afraid to say what
you mean, and to say it straight from the shoulder.
That's the Blount way, and I reckon we've got to
keep the family ball rolling&#8212;you and I. Don't forget
that, when you're making your appeal to those
horny-handed sons of toil over yonder at Ophir.
Give 'em straight facts, and back up the facts with
figures&#8212;if you happen to have the figures. When
do you pull out for <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>the mining-camp?"</p>

<p>"To-night, at nine-thirty. I can't get there in
time if I wait for the morning train." Then,
dismissing the political topic abruptly: "What do
you hear from Professor Anners?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's having the time of his life. I got him
a State permit, and scraped him up a bunch of
pick-and-shovel men, and he is digging out those
fossil skeletons by the wagon-load."</p>

<p>"And Miss Anners?" pursued Patricia's lover.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if she was having the time
of her life, too. I've given her the little four-seated
car to call her own while she is out here, and she
and Honoria go careering around the country&#8212;breaking
the speed limit every minute in the day,
I reckon."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you are giving her a good time," said
Evan, and he looked glad. Then he added regretfully:
"I wish I could get a chance to chase around
a little with them. I have seen almost nothing of
them since they came West. I should think Mrs.
Blount might bring Patricia down to the city once
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>in a while."</p>

<p>"Well, now! perhaps the young woman doesn't
want to come," laughed the senator. "You told
me you hadn't got her tag, son, and I'm beginning
to believe it's the sure-enough truth. What has she
got against you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; nothing in the wide world, save that
I don't fit into her scheme for her life-work."</p>

<p>The senator was eating calmly through his dessert.
"If you hadn't made up your mind so pointedly to
dislike Honoria, you might be getting a few tips on
that 'career' business along about now, son," he
remarked, and Evan was silent&#8212;had to be silent.
For, you see, he had been charging Patricia's continued
absence from the capital to nothing less than
spiteful design on the part of his father's wife.</p>

<p>It was at the cigar smoking in the lobby, after
the young man had made his preparations for the
journey and was waiting for the train-caller's announcement,
that the senator said quite casually:
"It's too bad you're going out of town to-night, son.
Honoria 'phoned me a little spell ago that she and
Patricia would be driving down after their dinner
to take in the Weatherford reception. You'll have
to miss 'em, won't you?"</p>

<p>The a<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>nnouncer was chanting the call for the
night train west, and the joint-debater got up and
thrust his hand-bag savagely into the hand of the
nearest porter.</p>

<p>"Isn't that just my infernal luck!" he lamented.
Then: "Give them my love, and tell them I hope
they will stay until I get back."</p>

<p>The senator rose and shook hands with the departing
debater. "Shall I say that to both of 'em?"
he asked, with the quizzical smile which Evan was
learning to expect.</p>

<p>"Yes; to both of them, if you like&#8212;only I suppose
Mrs. Blount will hold it against me. Good-night
and good-by. I'll be back day after to-morrow, if
the Ophir miners don't mob me."</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes after Evan Blount's
train had steamed Ophir-ward out of the Sierra
Avenue station that a dust-covered touring-car drew
up at the curb in front of the Inter-Mountain, and
the same porter who had put Blount's hand-bag
into the taxicab opened the tonneau door for two
ladies in muffling motor-coats and heavy veils.</p>

<p>The senator met the two late travellers in the
vestibule, and while the three were waiting for an
elevator a rapid fire of low-toned question and answer
passed between husband and wife.</p>
<p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></p>
<p>"You got Evan out of the way?" whispered the
wife.</p>

<p>The husband nodded. "That was easy. I passed
the word to Steuchfield, and he helped out on that&#8212;invited
Evan to come to Ophir to speak in a
joint debate. He left on the night train."</p>

<p>"And Hathaway? Will he be here?"</p>

<p>"He is here. Gantry has turned him down, according
to instructions, and he is clawing about in
the air, trying to get a fresh hold. I bluffed him;
told him he'd have to make his peace with you for
something, I didn't know what, before I could talk
to him."</p>

<p>Miss Anners was watching the elevator signal
glow as the car descended, and the wife's voice
sank to a still lower whisper.</p>

<p>"He will be at the Weatherfords'?" she inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is right sure to be; I told him you would be
there."</p>

<p>The small plotter nodded approval.</p>
<p><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></p>
<p>"Give us half an hour to dress, and have the car
ready," she directed; and then the senator put the
two into the elevator and turned away to finish his
cigar.</p>

<h3>IN THE HERBARIUM</h3>


<p>The Weatherfords, multimillionaire mine-people,
and so newly rich that the crisp bank-notes fairly
crackled when Mrs. Weatherford spent them, kept
their lackeyed and liveried state in a castle-like
mansion in Mesa Circle, the most expensive, if not
the most aristocratic, no-thoroughfare of the capital
city. Weatherford, the father, egged on by Mrs.
Weatherford, had political aspirations pointing toward
a United States senatorship, the election to
which would fall within the province of the next
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>legislature. The mine-owner himself, a pudgy little
man with a bald spot on top of his head and a
corner-grocery point of view carefully tucked away
inside of it&#8212;an outlook upon life which was a survival
from his hard-working past&#8212;would willingly
have dodged, but Mrs. Weatherford was inexorable.
There were two grown daughters and a growing
son, and it was for these that she was socially ambitious.</p>

<p>The reception for which the senator's wife and
her guest had driven thirty miles through the dust
of the sage-brush hills was one of the many moves
in Mrs. Weatherford's private campaign. For the
opening-gun occasion the great house in Mesa Circle
was lighted from basement to turret&#8212;to all of the
numerous turrets; an awning fringed with electric
bulbs sheltered the carpeted walk from the street
to the grand entrance, an army of lackeys paraded
in the vestibule, and the wives and daughters of
the bravest and best in the capital city's political
contingent stood with Mrs. Weatherford in the long
receiving-line.</p>

<p>From room to room in the vast house a curiously
assorted throng of the bid<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>den ones worked its way
as the jam and crush permitted. A firm believer
in the maxim that in numbers there is strength, the
hostess had made her invitation-list long and catholic.
For the gossips there were the crowded drawing-rooms,
for the hungry there were Lucullian tables,
and for the sentimentalists there was the conservatory.</p>

<p>It was a mark of the unashamed newness of the
Weatherford riches that the conservatory, a glass-and-iron
greenhouse, built out as an extension of
one of the drawing-rooms, was called "the herbarium."
It was a reproduction, on a generous scale,
of a tropical garden. Half-grown palms and banana-trees
made a well-ordered jungle of the softly lighted
interior; and if, in the gathering of her floral treasures,
Mrs. Weatherford had omitted any precious
bit of greenery whose cost would have shed additional
lustre upon the Weatherford resources, it was
because no one had remembered to mention the
name of it to her.</p>

<p>Ex-Senator Blount's party of three was fashionably
late at the function in Mesa Circle, but in the
crush filling the spacious drawing-rooms the hostess
and her long line of receiving assistants were still
on duty. Having successfully passed the line with
her husband and Patricia, little Mrs. Blount looked
about her, saw Mr. Richard Gantry, signalled t<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>o
him with her eyes, and, with the traffic manager for
her centre-rush to wedge a way through the crowded
rooms, was presently lost to sight&#8212;at least from
Miss Anners's point of view.</p>

<p>Whether she knew it or not, from the moment of
her appearance at the hostess's end of the long receiving-line,
the senator's wife had been marked and
followed in her slow progress through the rooms by
a thin-faced man who seemed to be nervously trying
to hunch himself into better relations with his ill-fitting
dress-coat, an eager gentleman whose hawk-like
eyes never lost sight of the little lady with her
hand on Gantry's arm. Only the senator saw and
remarked this bit of by-play, and he looked as if
he were enjoying it, the shrewd gray eyes lighting
humorously as he bent to hear what Patricia was
saying.</p>

<p>When his quarry stopped, as she did frequently
to chat with one or another of the guests, the man
with the hawk-like profile and the nervous hunch
circled warily, and once or twice seemed about to
make the opportunity which was so slow in making
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>itself. But it was not until the little lady in the
claret-colored party-gown had drifted, still with a
hand on Gantry's arm, in among the palm and banana trees
of the herbarium that the bird-of-prey
person made his swoop. A moment later Gantry,
taking a low-toned command from his companion,
was disappearing in the direction of the refreshment-tables,
and the lady looked up to say: "Dear me,
Mr. Hathaway, you almost startled me!"</p>

<p>"Did I?" said the lumber-king, rather grimly, if
he meant the query to be apologetic. "I am sorry.
I didn't mean to; but Mrs. Gordon said I would
find you here, and so I took the liberty of following
you. I'm needing a little straightening out, you
know, and&#8212;ah&#8212;would you mind letting me talk
business with you for a minute or two, Mrs.
Blount?"</p>

<p>She drew her gown aside, and made room for him
on the carved rustic settee, which was exceedingly
uncomfortable to sit in, but which was in perfect
harmony with the background of gigantic palmettos.
He nodded gratefully and took the place, and the
manner of his sitting down was that of a man who
wears evening-clothes only under compulsion.</p>

<p>"Business?" she was saying. "Certainly not; if
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>you can talk business in such a place as this"&#8212;giving
him the coveted permission.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it ain't what you'd call business&#8212;maybe
it's only politics," he resumed; then, with the
abruptness of one whose dealings have been with
men oftener than with women: "In the first place,
I wish you'd tell me what I've been doing to get
myself into your bad books."</p>

<p>She laughed easily. "Who said you had been
doing anything, Mr. Hathaway?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The senator," he answered shortly, adding:
"He told me I'd have to make my peace with you."</p>

<p>She had developed a sudden interest in the quaint
Japanese figures on the ivory sticks of her fan.
"You want something, Mr. Hathaway; what is it?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"I want to be put next in this pigs-in-clover railroad
puzzle," was the blunt statement of the need.
"Our freight contract with the Transcontinental is
about to expire, and I'd like to get it renewed on
the same terms as before."</p>
<p><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></p>
<p>"Well," she said ingenuously, "why don't you
do it?"</p>

<p>"I can't," he blustered. "Everybody has suddenly
grown mysterious or gone crazy&#8212;I don't
know which. Kittredge, the general superintendent,
don't seem to remember that we ever had
any contract, and Gantry is just as bad. And when
I go to the senator he tells me I must make my
peace with you. I'm left out in the cold; I can't
begin to <i>sabe</i> what the senator and these railroad
brass-collar men are driving at. I've got something
to sell; something that the railroad company needs.
Where the d&#8212;&#8212; I mean, where's the hitch?"</p>

<p>The small person in the fetching party-gown
reached up and pinched a leaf from a fragrant shrub
fronting the settee.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gantry has gone to fetch me an ice, and he
will be back in a very few minutes," she suggested
mildly. "Consider your peace made, Mr. Hathaway,
and tell me what I can do for you."</p>

<p>"You can put me next," said the lumber lord,
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>going back to the only phrase that seemed to fit
the exigencies of the case. "Why the&#8212;why can't
we get our contract renewed?"</p>

<p>The little lady was opening and shutting her fan
slowly. "What was your contract?" she inquired
innocently.</p>

<p>"If I thought you didn't know, I'd go a long
time without telling you," he said bluntly. "But
you do know. It's the rebate lumber rate from our
mills at Twin Buttes and elsewhere, and it was given
us two years ago, a few days before election."</p>

<p>"And the consideration?" she asked, looking up
quickly.</p>

<p>"You know that, too, Mrs. Blount. It was the
swinging of the solid employees' vote of the Twin
Buttes Lumber Company over to the railroad ticket."</p>

<p>"And you wish to make the same arrangement
again?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. We've got to have that preferential
rate or go out of business."</p><p><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></p>

<p>"With whom did you make the contract two
years ago?"</p>

<p>"With Mr. McVickar, verbally. Of course, there
wasn't anything put down in black and white, but
the railroad folks did their part and we did ours."</p>

<p>"I see&#8212;a gentleman's agreement," she murmured;
and then: "You have tried Mr. McVickar again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he referred me to Gantry."</p>

<p>"And what did Mr. Gantry say?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't get him to say anything with any
sense in it," said the lumber magnate grittingly.
"The most I could get out of him was that I would
have to see the boss."</p>

<p>"And instead of doing that you went to see the
senator?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I did. Who else would Gantry mean
by 'the boss'?" demanded the befogged one.</p>
<p><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></p>
<p>"Possibly he meant the senator's son," she ventured,
tapping a pretty cheek with the folded fan.
"Have you been leaving Evan Blount out in all of
this?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know where to put him in. That's what
brings me here to-night. The senator, or McVickar,
or both of them together, have set the whole State
to running around in circles with this appointment
of young Blount. Some say it's a deal between the
senator and McVickar, and some say it's a fight.
Half of the professional spellbinders are walking in
their sleep over it right now. I thought maybe
you could tell me, Mrs. Blount."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you anything that would help the
people who are walking in their sleep," she returned,
"but I might offer a suggestion in your personal
affair. Mr. Evan Blount is your man."</p>

<p>Hathaway pursed his thin lips and frowned.
"I'm in bad there&#8212;right at the jump," he objected.</p>

<p>"I know," she shot back quickly. "For some
reason best known to yourself, you saw fit to have
Mr. Evan waylaid and man-handled on <a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>the first
night of his return to his native State. But you
needn't worry about that. He won't hold it against
you. I'm sure you'll find him entirely amenable to
reason."</p>

<p>The tyrant of "timber-jacks" frowned again.
"H'm&#8212;reason, eh? How big a block of Twin
Buttes stock shall I offer him?"</p>

<p>Her laugh was a silvery peal of derision.</p>

<p>"You always figure in dollars and cents, don't
you, Mr. Simon Peter Hathaway?" she mocked.</p>

<p>"I have always found it the cheapest in the end."</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, with the folded fan held up
like a monitory finger. "Mr. Gantry may be back
any minute, and I can give you only the tiniest
hint. You must go to Mr. Evan Blount and appeal
to him frankly, as one business man to another."</p>

<p>"But I have heard&#8212;they say he's all kinds of a
crank."</p>

<p>"Never mind what you have heard. Tell him all
the facts and ask him to help you, and for mercy's
sake don't offer him a block of your stock. Put it
where it will do the most good. Put it in the name
of Professor William J. Anners, of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and show Mr. Blount how dreadfully
disastrous the loss of the preferential freight rate
would be to all the poor people in your list of stock-holders&#8212;including
Professor Anners."</p>
<p><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></p>
<p>Hathaway drew down his cuff and made a pencil
memorandum of the name and address of the new
beneficiary.</p>

<p>"You'll notice that I'm not asking any foolish
questions about who this Professor Anners is, or
why I should be making him a present of a block
of stock. If I don't, it's because what you say goes
as it lies. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes; don't fail to be perfectly frank with Mr.
Blount, and don't let him put you off. He may
pretend to be very angry at first, but you won't
mind that."</p>

<p>"I won't mind anything if I can bring this business
down to the every-day commonplace earth once
more. You and the senator and Gantry and McVickar
are playing some sort of a game, and you
ain't showing me anything more than the back of
the cards. That's all right. I guess I'm fly enough
to play my hand blindfolded, if I've got to. I don't
care, just so I win the odd trick."</p>

<p>Gantry was coming down the avenue of banana-trees
with the ice he had taken so much time to
procure, and the lumber magnate rose reluctantly.
There was time for only one more question, and he
put it hastily.</p>

<p>"When and where can I find Evan Blount?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The day after to-morrow, at his office in Temple
Court. He is out of the city now, but&#8212;" Here
Gantry's coming put an end to the private conference,
and the president of the Twin Buttes company went his way.</p>
<p><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></p>
<p>Not until they had served out their full sentence
at Mrs. Weatherford's crush, and were back in the
private dining-room suite at the Inter-Mountain,
with Miss Anners safely behind the closed door of
her own apartment, did the small conspirator pass
the word of good hope on to her husband.</p>

<p>"It is working beautifully," she exulted. "He
will go to see Evan day after to-morrow&#8212;and after
that, the deluge."</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT GAME</h3>


<p>If Evan Blount, as the representative of the unpopular
railroad, had been anticipating an unfriendly
reception at the great gold-camp in the Carnadine
Hills, he was agreeably disappointed. A committee
of citizens, headed by Jasper Steuchfield, the "Paramounter"
chairman for Carnadine County, met him
at the train, escorted him to the hotel, and, during
the afternoon which was at his disposal, gave him
joyously and hilariously the freedom of the camp.</p>

<p>The polit<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>ical meeting, called for an early hour in
the evening, was held in the Carnadine Mining
Company's ore-shed, electric-lighted for the occasion.
When the hour came the big shed was packed
with an enthusiastic audience, and there were prolonged
cheers and hand-clappings when the railroad
advocate took his seat on the improvised platform
as the guest of the local committee.</p>

<p>Later, when Judge Crowley, candidate prospective
on the popular ticket for the State Senate, opened
the joint debate with a shrewd arraignment of the
methods of the railroad company, not only in its
dealings with the public as a common carrier, but
also in the pertinacity with which it invaded the
political field, there was tumultuous applause; but
it was no heartier than that which greeted Blount
when he rose to present the railroad side of the
argument.</p>

<p>During the journey from the capital, which had
consumed the night and the greater portion of the
forenoon, he had prepared his speech. His argument&#8212;the
one unanswerable argument, as it appeared
to him&#8212;was the absurdity and injustice of a
law which presumed to limit the earning power of
a corporation by fixing the maximum rates it might
charge, without at the same time making a corresponding
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>regulation fixing the price which the company
should pay for its labor and material.</p>

<p>Upon this foundation he was able to build a fair
structure of oratory. The judge, his opponent, was
a rather turgid man whose speech had abounded
in flights of denunciation and whose appeal had
been made frankly to prejudice and party rancor.
Blount took his cue shrewdly. Touching lightly
upon the public grievances, some of which he characterized
as just and entirely defensible, he rang the
changes calmly and logically upon the square deal,
no less for the corporations than for the individual.
"Take it to yourselves, you merchants," he urged.
"Imagine a law on the statute-books fixing the
prices at which you shall sell your goods, and that
same law leaving you at the mercy of those from
whom you must buy! Take it to yourselves, you
miners. Suppose the legislature had enacted a law
fixing the maximum price at which you shall sell
your skill and your labor, and at the same time
leaving it optional with every man from whom you
buy, the butcher, the baker, the grocer, to charge
you what he pleases or what he can get! That, my
good friends, is the situation of the railroad company
in this State to-day"&#8212;and he went on to
analyze the hard situation, filling his hour very
creditably and, if the frequent bursts of applause
could be taken to mean anything, to the complete
satisf<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>action of his hearers. Indeed, at the end of
his argument he was given what the local paper of
the following day was pleased to call "a spontaneous
and pandemonious ovation."</p>

<p>After the cheering and hand-shaking, Steuchfield
and his fellow-committeemen went to the train with
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>the visiting speaker, and no one in the throng of
congratulators was more enthusiastic than the opposition
chairman.</p>

<p>"That was a cracking good speech&#8212;a great speech,
Mr. Blount!" he said, as the branch train rattled in
from the north. "If you can go all over the State
making as good talks as the one we've just heard,
you'll tie the whole shooting-match up in a hard
knot for us fellows. But McVickar won't let you
do it&#8212;not by a long shot!"</p>

<p>The potential tier of hard knots laughed genially.
"I don't blame you for wanting to be shown, Mr.
Steuchfield. But I can assure you that the new
policy has come to stay. I have the management
behind me in this thing, and any day you'll come
down to the capital I'll put my time against yours
and try to show you that we are out for open publicity
and a square deal for every man&#8212;including
the railroad man."</p>

<p>"All right," was the cordial reply. "I'll be down
along some of these days, and if you can conv<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>ince
me that McVickar isn't going into politics any further
than you've gone here to-night, I'll promise you
to come back to Carnadine and tell the boys the
jig's up."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the branch train pulled out,
and the chairman and his fellow-committeemen gave
the departing joint-debater three cheers and another.
After the red tail-lights of the train had disappeared
around the first curve, Steuchfield turned
to the others with a broad grin.</p>

<p>"Well, boys," he said, "there goes a mighty nice
young fellow, and I guess we did it up all right for
him and accordin' to orders. I don't know any
more'n a sheep what sort of a game Dave Sage-brush
is playin' this time, but whatever he says
goes as she lays, and I figure it that we gave the
young chip o' the old block a right jubilant little
whirl. Anyhow, he seemed to think so."</p>

<p>Blount did not reach his office in the capital until
the afternoon of the next day. There was an appalling
accumulation of letters and telegrams waiting
to be worked over, but he let the desk litter go untouched
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>and called up the hotel, only to have a
small disappointment sent in over the wire. His
father, Mrs. Blount, and their guest had left for
Wartrace Hall some time during the forenoon, and
there had been nothing said in the clerk's hearing
about their return to the city. Blount hung up the
receiver, called it one more opportunity missed, and
sat down to attack the desk litter.</p>

<p>Almost the first thing his eye lighted upon was
a stenographer's note stating that Mr. Hathaway,
president of the Twin Buttes Lumber Company,
had been in several times, and was very anxious
to obtain an interview. Blount pressed the desk
button, and the stenographer came in promptly.</p>

<p>"This man Hathaway; what did he want?" was
the brusque question shot at the clerk.</p>

<p>"I don't know. He said he was stopping at the
Inter-Mountain, and he asked me to let him know
when you got back."</p>

<p>"Phone him and tell him I'm here," said Blount;
and in due time the lumber magnate made his appearance.</p><p><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></p>

<p>It was not at all in keeping with Mr. Simon Peter
Hathaway's gifts and adroitness that he should begin
by attempting a clumsy bit of acting.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be shot!" he exclaimed. "So you're
the senator's son, are you? If I'd known that, that
day on the train when you were trying to make me
believe you were one of Uncle Sam's men&#8212;"</p>

<p>Blount's smile was neither forgiving nor hostile.</p>

<p>"In a way, I had earned what was handed out
to me afterward, Mr. Hathaway, and I'm not bearing
malice," he said briefly. "I had no business to
let you get away with the wrong impression, but
you were so exceedingly anxious to identify me with
the Forest Service that it seemed a pity to disappoint
you. Since your scoundrels didn't kill me,
we'll set one incident against the other and forget
both. What can I do for you to-day?"</p>

<p>By this time the lumber lord was apparently recovering
his breath and some measure of composure,
though he had lost neithe<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>r.</p>

<p>"Great Jehu!" he lamented. "If you had given
me half a hint that you were Dave Blount's son&#8212;but
you didn't, you know, and now I'm handicapped
just when I oughtn't to be. I've come to
talk business with you to-day, Mr. Blount, and here
you've got me on the run the first crack out of the
box!"</p>

<p>This time Blount's smile was entirely conciliatory.</p>

<p>"Don't let that little misfire in the Lost Mountain
foot-hills embarrass you, Mr. Hathaway. I
assure you I'm not at all vindictive."</p>

<p>"All right," said the visitor, only too willing to
dismiss the Jack Barto incident and the forced awkwardness
of the pretended surprise. "That being
the case, I'll jump in on the other matter. But
first I'd like to ask a sort of personal question: I've
been given to understand that you are handling the
political business for the railroad company in this
campaign. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"It is <a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>and it isn't," was the prompt reply. "The
railroad company isn't in politics in this campaign&#8212;as
a political factor, I mean. What we are trying
to do&#8212;and all we are trying to do&#8212;is to lay
the entire matter plainly and fairly before the people
of this State, with a frank appeal for the relief to
which we are entitled."</p>

<p>"Ha&#8212;h'm&#8212;I guess I get you, Mr. Blount.
That's the way to talk it; in public, anyway. But,
just between us two&#8212;I guess we needn't beat the
bushes in a little personal talk like this&#8212;we both
know there are certain things that have to be done
in every campaign; things you wouldn't want to
publish in the newspapers."</p>

<p>Blount sat back in his chair and the conciliatory
smile disappeared.</p>

<p>"What kind of things?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I don't know all of 'em. But
there was one little arrangement that was made two
years ago with us, and it helped out both ways. I
thought I'd come around and see if it couldn't be
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>worked again."</p>

<p>"State the facts," said Blount shortly.</p>

<p>"It was like this. As you know, we've got a
number of plants scattered around at different
places in the State, and, one way and another, we
employ a good many men. These men are residents
of the State, but you couldn't call 'em citizens
in the sense that they take any active interest
in what's going on. They're here this year, and
they may be up among the Oregon redwoods next
year, and somewhere else the year after. When
they vote at all they naturally ask us how we'd
like to have 'em vote; and that's the way it was
two years ago at election time."</p>

<p>"I see. But how does this concern the railroad company?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that, right now. Two years ago
we found that our employees' vote was big enough
to turn the scale in four of the legislative districts
and to cut a pretty good-sized figure in a fifth. This
vote was worth something to your people, and the
fact was properly recognized. I don't know but
what I'm telling you a lot of stale news, but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Go on, Mr. Hathaway; if I wasn't greatly interested
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>in the beginning, I am now. How was the
fact recognized by the Transcontinental Railway
Company?"</p>

<p>"It was just as easy as twice two. The Twin
Buttes Lumber Company is practically the only
heavy lumber-shipper in this inter-mountain territory,
and it was given a preferential rate on its
products; you might say that the amount of business
we do entitles us to some special consideration,
anyway. There wasn't any bargain and sale about
it, you understand. It was just a sort of friendly
recognition of our help in the election."</p>

<p>"This rate is lower than the rate made to other
lumber-shippers?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; but, after all, it isn't any big thing.
If you were up on lumber rates, Mr. Blount&#8212;as I
don't suppose you are&#8212;you'd know that the special
tariff we get is all that enables us to live and do
business."</p>

<p>Blount had opened his penknife and was absently
sharpening a pencil.</p>

<p>"This special rate you refer to, Mr. Hathaway,"
he said, speaking slowly and quite distinctly&#8212;"am
I right in inferring that it is not confined strictly to
points within the State boundaries?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></p>
<p>At this the lumberman repeated a phrase which
he had used in the anxious conference in the Weatherford
herbarium.</p>

<p>"If I thought you didn't know, I'd go a long
time without telling you, Mr. Blount. But of course
you do know. If you wasn't on the inside of all
the insides you wouldn't be sitting here pulling the
strings for McVickar. The rate is a blanket; it
covers all shipments."</p>

<p>Blount nodded and his apparent coolness was no
just measure of the inward fires the crooked lumber-king
was kindling.</p>

<p>"You interest me greatly, Mr. Hathaway. I am
a little new to these things&#8212;as you intimated a few
moments ago. How is this matter handled&#8212;by
rebates, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"N-not exactly," was the hesitating denial.
"That would be too risky for both of us. But
the Transcontinental Company is a heavy buyer&#8212;lumber
and cross-ties and bridge timber, you
know&#8212;and the biggest part of the difference between
our special and the regular rate is taken up
in our bills for material furnished to the railroad."</p>

<p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>"Let me be quite clear upon that point," said
Blount; and if Hathaway had had eyes to see, he
would have observed that the young lawyer's attitude
was becoming more judicial with every fresh
questioning. "Let me be quite sure that I understand.
You mean that you are allowed to charge
the railroad company more than the market price
on the material it buys?"</p>

<p>Hathaway nodded. "Yes, that's the way of it."</p>
<p><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></p>
<p>"And this preferential rate is still in force?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"You're sure you have had no notice of its withdrawal&#8212;say
within the past few weeks?"</p>

<p>It was at this point that the lumber lord began
to fear that some one had slipped a cog in sending
him to first one and then another, and finally to
young Blount.</p>

<p>"Of course, it hasn't been withdrawn!" he retorted.
And then: "You seem to think there is
something off color in the deal, Mr. Blount, and I
don't know whether you're stringing me or whether
you're too new in the railroad game to have the
dope. If you're going into this political knock-down-and-drag-out,
you ought to have the dope.
There isn't a big interest in this State&#8212;ore-shippers,
power people, irrigation companies, or any of 'em&#8212;that<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>
ain't getting a rake-off. I guess you <i>are</i> stringing
me; I guess you know all this a good deal better
than I do. If you don't, I can tell you that it's a
fact; not a 'has-been', but an 'is'! Ask Gantry;
he'll tell you, if he tells the truth. We ain't asking
or getting anything that other people ain't getting!"</p>

<p>"I see," said Blount soberly. "What do you expect
me to do, Mr. Hathaway?"</p>

<p>"I want you to set the wheels in motion so that
we can have our rate made good for another two
years&#8212;on the same terms as before. You're going
to need every vote you can get this year, and you
can't afford to turn us down." Then the lumber-king
shifted again to his own necessities. "It's the
only way we can live and do business nowadays.
Like every other large corporation, we've got an
army of little investors to look out for: widows,
orphans, charitable institutions, and trustees' accounts.
I've got a list of our stockholders right
here, and I'd like to have you look it over."</p>

<p>Blount took the paper mechanically, and quite
as mechanically ran his eye down the list of names.
At the bottom of it, written in with a pen, was the
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>name of Patricia's father, with his residence and occupation.
While he was staring at the pen-written
name, Hathaway went on, eloquently emphasizing
the disastrous results which would fall upon the people
for whom he was, in the larger sense, a guardian
and a trustee&#8212;the disaster hinging upon the
withdrawal of the preferential rate.</p>

<p>Blount broke him abruptly in the midst of the
special plea. "I see you have recently added one
new name to this list: the name of Professor Anners.
How&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted the Twin Buttes diplomatist
hastily, fearing that this legal-minded young man
would presently be asking questions too hard to be
answered; "now there's a case in point: Mr. Anners
is a good example of our smaller stockholders. Men
like Anners, college professors, preachers, and so on,
buy stocks, when they buy 'em at all, for an investment&#8212;for
the income&#8212;and they pay for 'em out
of their hard-earned savings."</p>

<p>"I know," said Blount, and, since he was the last
man in the world to be diverted from his purpose
by any conversational dust-throwing, he pressed
the question cut off by the hasty interruption.
"What I was going to ask wa<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>s how you happen
to have added Professor Anners's name to your
list&#8212;recently, it seems?"</p>

<p>The lumberman was reduced to the necessity of
inventing a ready lie. He had obeyed his instructions
blindly, on the supposition that young Blount
would know and understand.</p>

<p>"Anners? Oh, he knows a good thing when he
sees it; and I guess maybe your father put him on.
He's a friend of the family, ain't he? Maybe the
senator found a little chunk of 'Twin Buttes' that
he didn't want himself, and passed it along."</p>

<p>Blount's blood ran cold at the sight of the cracking
walls and crumbling foundations on every hand.
The proof that the railroad company's lawless attitude
was still unchanged was too strong to be
doubted; and now there was an added blow from
the hand of his father. He wheeled short upon the
lumber-king.</p>

<p>"Who sent you to me, Mr. Hathaway?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The hawk-faced man laughed. "I guess you
know just as well or better than I do. But just
to show you that I can keep my mouth shut, I ain't
going to tell you. It's all right and straigh<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>t&#8212;and
you might say it's all in the family, counting the
professor in on the side, as it were."</p>

<p>"I see," Blount said, and this time he was only
too sure that he did see. Then: "What is it you
want me to do for you, Mr. Hathaway? You have
told me once, but I'm afraid I didn't grasp it fully."</p>

<p>"Fix it with Gantry, or somebody, so that we can
put the company vote where it's most needed and
get our rate continued. It's simple enough."</p>

<p>"The simplicity is beyond question." Blount returned
the list of stockholders and fell back upon
the pencil-sharpening. "It is quite elementary, as
you say; but there is another phase of the transaction
which seems to have escaped you. Are you
aware that the present arrangement which you have
so accurately described, and the continuance of it
which you are proposing, are crimes for which both
parties involved may be called into court and punished?"</p>

<p>Hathaway started as if the comfortable chair in
which he was lounging had been suddenly electrified.</p>

<p>"Say, Blount, are you working for the railroad,<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>
or not?" he demanded. "If you are, what in the
name of Heaven are you driving at? I know the
line of talk you've been handing out since McVickar
gave you your job and set you up in business here,
but that's for the dear public. You don't have to
wear your halo when a man comes in to talk hard
facts from the inside. It comes to just this: you
do something for me, and I do something for you.
You make it possible for us to live and sell lumber,
and we do what we can to make it easy for your
railroad to get its 'square deal' from a pie-cutting
legislature. That's the whole thing in a nutshell."</p>

<p>"One more question," snapped Blount, striving to
fix the roving gaze of the hawk-like eyes. "With
whom did you make this arrangement two years
ago?"</p>

<p>"With your boss, if you want to know; with Mr.
McVickar himself!"</p>

<p>"And you think you can do it again?"</p>

<p>"I know damned well I can; only I don't care
to go over your head unless I have to. They tell
me you're handling this end of it for the railroad
company, and I'm not going around hunting a
chance to make enemies. That's all I've got to
say"&#8212;and he rose to go&#8212;"all but this: you've got
a lot to learn about this something-for-something
business, and the quicker you get at it, Mr. Blount,
the sooner you'll arrive somewhere. About this
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>little matter of ours, there's no special hurry. Take
your own time to think it over; take it up with
McVickar, if you want to. Then, when you get
things fixed, wire me one word to Twin Buttes.
Just say 'Yes,' and sign your name to it. That'll
be enough."</p>

<p>For a long half-hour after the president of the
Twin Buttes Lumber Company and its allied corporations
had closed the door of the private office
behind him, Blount sat rocking gently in his pivot-chair.
In the fulness of time the bitter thoughts
wrought their way into words.</p>

<p>"So this is what I was hired for!" he mused, "a
fence; a wretched mask put up to hide the trickery
and chicanery and criminality&#8212;the crookedness
which has never been put aside; which nobody
ever meant to put aside! My God! they've let me
stultify myself in a thousand ways; let me sit here
day after day with a lie in my mouth, saying things
that nobody in this God-forsaken homeland of mine
has believed for a single minute! After it's all over,
every man who has listened to me will say that I
<i>knew</i>&#8212;that all this talk about openness and fair
dealing was simply that much dust-throwing to
hide the workings of a corrupt and criminal machine
grinding away in the background!"</p><p><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></p>

<p>He turned to his desk and sat with his head propped
in his hands, staring at the little photograph of Wartrace
Hall which he had had mounted in a plateglass
paper-weight. The sight gave an added twist
to the torture screw and he broke out again.</p>

<p>"I've been nothing more than a bit of potter's
clay, and the master potter&#8212;God help me!&#8212;is my
own father! It's all plain enough now. He saw
that I wasn't going to fall in with the attorney-general
scheme; or perhaps he saw that I might
be a stumbling-block if I should; so he planned
this thing with McVickar&#8212;planned it deliberately!
There is no fight, after all; it's merely one of the
moves in the game that the 'boss' and the railroad
should seem to be fighting each other. Good God!
I can't believe it, and yet I've got to believe it.
That man Hathaway is a self-confessed criminal,
but he was telling the truth about the law-breaking
trickery that is going on; he wouldn't be idiotic
enough to lie and then give me a chance to prove
the lie. And he didn't come to me of his own volition;
he was sent&#8212;sent to break me down, and sent
by.... Oh, dad, dad! how could you do it!"</p>

<p>With his face hidden in the crook of his arm, he
was groping in vain outreachings<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a> for something to
lay hold of, for some clear-minded, clean-hearted
adviser who could tell him what to do; how he
should clamber out of this pit of humiliation into
which nothing more culpable than an honest zeal
for civic righteousness had precipitated him. In his
despair he told himself that there was no one, and
then suddenly he remembered&#8212;Patricia would know,
and she would understand better than any one else
in a populous world how to point the way out of the
labyrinth. He must go to her and tell her. In
the meantime....</p>

<p>He got up and shut his desk with a slam. In the
meantime there should be no more lies told&#8212;no
more turns taken in the crooked path. Collins, the
stenographer, heard the noise of the desk closing
and came to the door of the private room, note-book
and pencil in hand. "Anything to give me
before you go out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blount almost savagely. "Take a
message to Mr. McVickar. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>The stenographer nodded.</p>

<p>Blount dictated curtly: "'Pending another interview
with you in person, I shall close my offices in
Temple Court and confine myself strictly to the
routine legal business of the company. Meanwhile,
my resignation is in your hands if you wish to appoint
a new division counsel.' Have you<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a> got that,
Collins? Very well; write it out and send it at
once. I shall be at the Inter-Mountain for a little
while, if you want to reach me between now and
closing time."</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h3>A WELL-SPRING IN THE DESERT</h3>


<p>Going to the hotel, Blount shut himself into a
telephone booth and tried, ineffectually, to get a
long-distance connection with Wartrace Hall. When
he finally grew exasperated at the central operator's
oft-repeated "line's busy," he called up Gantry to
ask if the traffic manager knew anything about the
purposes and movements of his father. Gantry did
not know, but he knew something else&#8212;a thing
which proved the leakiness of the railroad telegraph
department.</p>

<p>"Come down here and tell me what you mean by
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>sending incendiary telegrams to the vice-president,"
he commanded, with jesting severity. And with a
hard word for the department which had gossiped,
Blount went down to the general offices in the station
building.</p>

<p>Gantry was busy with the stenographer, but the
business was immediately postponed and the clerk
dismissed when Blount entered.</p>

<p>"'Tell it out among the heathen,'" the traffic
manager quoted jocosely, when the door closed behind
the shorthand man.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell&#8212;more than you seem
to know already," snapped Blount morosely. "I
have wired my resignation, that's all."</p>

<p>"But why?" persisted Gantry.</p>

<p>"Because I'm not going to be an accessory, either
before or after the fact&#8212;not if I know it," was the
curt rejoinder.</p>

<p><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>"An accessory to what?"</p>

<p>"To the criminal disregard for the laws of this
State and the nation which seems to be the underlying
motive actuating every move in this corrupt game
of politics. Gantry, if you and some others had
your just deserts, you would be breaking stone in
the penitentiary this blessed minute!"</p>

<p>"Suffering Moses!" gasped the traffic manager.
"Somebody must have been hitting you pretty
hard. Who was it; some more of the 'little brothers'?"</p>

<p>At another time Blount might have been less
angry, and, by consequence, more discreet.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't any of the 'little brothers'; it was
Mr. Simon P. Hathaway, president of the Twin
Buttes Lumber Company."</p>

<p>Gantry drew a long breath which ended in a low
whistle.</p>

<p>"So that's what you were let in for, was it?" he
exclaimed, and then he checked h<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>imself abruptly
and went back to the original contention. "But
you're not going to throw down your tools and walk
out, Evan. You can't afford to do that."</p>

<p>"Why can't I?"</p>

<p>"Because you have committed yourself right and
left. No man can afford to drop out of the ranks
on the eve of a battle. You are not stopping to
consider the construction which will be put upon
any such hasty action on your part."</p>

<p>"I am not stopping to consider anything, Dick,
save the fact that I was evidently expected to connive
at a cynical and criminal disregard for the law
of the land, the law which, as a member of the bar,
I have sworn to uphold and defend. That is enough
for me. I don't have to be knocked down and run
over before I can realize that it's time to get out of
the way."</p>

<p>"You say it's enough for you; it won't be enough
for Mr. McVickar," Gantry interposed. "If you
could afford to drop out&#8212;and I'm not admitting that
you can&#8212;he cou<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>ldn't afford to let you." Then, with
sudden gravity: "Hadn't you better let me hold up
that telegram of yours for a few hours, Evan, until
you've had time to cool down and think it over?"</p>

<p>Blount sprang from his chair in a white heat.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that you are already
holding it up?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I took the liberty of holding it up&#8212;temporarily,"
confessed the traffic man coolly. "There is no
harm done. Mr. McVickar is on his way West now,
and he will be here in a day or two. Why not kill
the message and have it out with him in person
when he comes?"</p>

<p>Blount was not to be so easily appeased.</p>

<p>"I won't have my communications tampered
with!" he exploded. "If you have given an order
to have that telegram held out, you can give another
to have it sent immediately!"</p>

<p>"All<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a> right," said Gantry; "just as you say." And
he made no effort to detain the enraged one who was
turning his back and striding away. But after the
self-discharged political manager was gone, the traffic
man chuckled quietly and turned up a square of
paper which had been lying on his desk during the
short and belligerent interview.</p>

<p>"It's a nice lay-out," he mused, reading the
type-written lines over again, "but the little lady
was too fly for you this time, Evan, my boy. She
was just prophetess enough to guess where and how
you would go off the handle, clever enough to pass
me the word to watch the wires after a certain train
should get in from Ophir to-day. Great little woman,
that. I believe she figures out more than half of
the fine moves in the Honorable Senator's game,
though this particularly fine move of sending Hathaway
to touch a match to Evan's little powder-keg
is one that I don't begin to understand." And he
folded the telegram and carefully put it away in his
pocket-book.</p>

<p>Evan Blount walked three squares beyond the
Inter-Mountain Hotel before he had cooled down
sufficiently to determine what to do next. As it
chanced, the cooling-down process had led him to
the door of the public garage patronized by his
father. That thought of flying to Patricia for counsel
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>and comfort was still with him, but it was over-shadowed
by a more militant desire to fight somebody;
to go to his father and tell him how completely
and successfully he had plotted with the vice-president
to humiliate a son whose only offence was a
decent regard for honor and uprightness.</p>

<p>Acting upon the impulse of the moment, he went
in and asked if any of Senator Blount's cars were
in the city. There was one&#8212;the big roadster; and
Blount's decision was taken instantly. On that first
day at Wartrace Hall his father had tried to give
him one of the three motor-cars outright, and when
he had refused to take it as a gift, a compromise had
been made by which he was under promise to use
any one of the machines he could get hold of when
the need arose. Accordingly, a few minutes later
he was behind the steering-wheel of the fast roadster,
picking his way through the traffic-burdened
city streets and pointing straight for the country
road leading north to the sage-brush hills.</p>

<p>Now, among its many attractions, motoring numbers&#8212;from
the driver's point of view&#8212;this: that
it effectually sweeps the brain of all other cares and
distractions, sundry and several, since one may not
drive a high-powered car at speed and successfully
think of anything but th<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>e driving. Blount
reached the entrance to the cottonwood-shaded avenue
at Wartrace Hall just before the dinner hour;
and he was so far recovered from the attack of righteous
indignation that he was able to meet his father
and the others with a fair degree of equanimity. In
the back part of his mind, however, he held the
fighting ultimatum in suspense. In the course of
the evening he would make his opportunity and have
it out, once for all, with the master plotter. So
much he determined while he was dressing for dinner.
But the course of events is sometimes a most
unmalleable thing, as he was presently to learn.</p>

<p>At the dinner-table it was the professor who
monopolized the conversation, holding forth learnedly
and dictatorially upon matters pertaining solely
to the Pliocene age, and never once suffering the
talk to approach nearer than several million years
to the twentieth century. And at the dispersal&#8212;only
there was no dispersal&#8212;the senator took his
turn, leading the way to the great wainscoted living-room
and persuading Patricia to go to the piano.</p>

<p>The young man with the fighting determination
in the back part of his brain bided his time. He
was willing enough to listen to Grieg and Brahms
as they were interpreted by Patricia, but the greater
matter was still outweighing the lesser. Further
along, when <a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>Miss Anners had played herself out,
Blount tried to break the obstructing combination.
But, in spite of his efforts, the talk drifted back to
the dinosaurs and the pterodactyls, and when he
finally went away to smoke, he did it alone.</p>

<p>The Wartrace Hall den was an annex to the living-room,
and through the bamboo <i>portières</i> he could
hear the animated hum of the prehistoric discussion,
in which Patricia had now joined as a loyal daughter
should. Hoping against hope that the professor
would some time go to bed, and that his father would
come to the den for his bedtime whiff at the long-stemmed
pipe, Blount smoked and waited. But
when his patience was finally rewarded, it was not
the Honorable Senator who drew the bamboo <i>portières</i>
aside and entered the cosey smoking-room. It
was Patricia, and she was alone.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps I should find you here," she
said, taking the easy chair at the opposite corner
of the fireplace where a tiny wood fire was blazing
in deference to the chill of the approaching autumn.
"Did we bore you to death with the Pliocenes?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," he admitted grudgingly. "But
since I hadn't remembered to have myself born six
or seven million years ago, I can't somehow seem to
galvanize a very active interest in the dead-and-gone
periods."</p><p><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></p>

<p>"Nor I," she confessed frankly, "though for
daddy's sake I do try to. But for us who are
living to-day there are so many problems of critically
vital importance&#8212;problems that the pterodactyls
never knew anything about."</p>

<p>"I know," returned the young man, half-absently.
"I am up against one of them, right now, and I don't
know how to solve it."</p>

<p>"Will it bear telling?" she asked, and he hoped
that the sympathy in her tone was personal rather
than conventional.</p>

<p>"It will not only bear telling; it demands to be
told to some one whose sense of right and wrong
has not been drawn and quartered and flayed alive
until it has no longer life or breath left with which
to protest," and thereupon he told her circumstantially
all that had befallen him since the eventful
evening on which he had forsaken the wrecked
train at Twin Buttes, concluding with the story of
the lumber magnate's attempt at corruption, of
which he suppressed nothing but the fact that her
father's name appeared in Mr. Hathaway's list of
share-holders. When he had made an end, her eyes
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>were shining, though whether with quickened sympathy
or indignation he could not determine.</p>

<p>"What did you do?" she asked, referring to the
incident of the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I didn't do half enough!" he fumed. "I'm
afraid I let Hathaway escape without being told
plainly enough what a hopelessly irreclaimable
scoundrel he is. When he edged out of the door,
he was still telling me to take my time to think it
over, and was indicating the way in which I might
communicate my consent without committing anybody.
I made a mistake in not firing him bodily!"</p>

<p>Miss Anners was tapping one daintily shod foot
on the tiled hearth.</p>

<p>"You made your greatest mistake in the very
beginning, Evan," she said decisively. "You should
have made a confidant of your father."</p>

<p>"I did try to," he protested. "Everything was
all right until this political business came up between
us. But that opened the rift. I couldn't
do as he wanted me to, and my sympathies were
with the corporations which I thought he was fighting
unjustly. So when Mr. McVickar made me an
offer, I accepted in good faith, believing that I could
really do something toward bringing about a better
understanding."</p><p><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></p>

<p>"And now you believe you can't?&#8212;that it is impossible?"</p>

<p>"Not wholly impossible, I suppose. But the 'great
game' seems to be everything in this benighted commonwealth,
and everybody plays it&#8212;my father,
his wife, the railroad officials, and the politicians.
Surely you wouldn't say that I should have let father
put me on the State ticket as a candidate,
knowing&#8212;as I could not help knowing&#8212;that I would
be expected to carry out the designs of the machine
regardless of right and wrong?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," was the quick reply, "not if you
were convinced that the motive&#8212;your father's motive&#8212;was
unworthy. But if you have been telling
me the truth, and all the truth, I should say that
you didn't stop to inquire what his motive was."</p>

<p>"What was the use of inquiring?" he demanded
moodily. "He is the boss, and he would have used
the machine to put me into office as attorney-general.
In other words, I should have owed my election,
not to the will and selection of the people, but to
the will of one man, and that man my nearest kinsman;
a man who is, beyond all question of doubt,
working hand in glove with all the trickery and
double-d<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>ealing practised by the corporations. Under
such conditions, would it have been possible
for me to accept and to administer the office without
fear or favor?"</p>

<p>"I don't know why not," she returned. "Notwithstanding
your charge&#8212;which merely shows how
angry you are&#8212;your 'nearest kinsman,' as you call
him, would have been the last man in the world to
interfere. Wasn't that the very reason he gave
you for wanting to put you on the ticket?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Blount, whose mind was beginning
to cloud again. "But there are so many other
mysteries. We'll say that my father honestly
wanted me to stand for the candidacy. But right
in the midst of things he conspires with Mr. McVickar
to put me into my present unspeakable dilemma."</p>

<p>Her smile was gently reproachful.</p>

<p>"It is my poor opinion, Evan, that you don't half
appreciate your father. Worse than that, you don't
know him. But that is beside the present mark.
What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I have already done it. I have wired my resignation
to Mr. McVickar, and he will doubtless
accept it."</p>

<p>She was looking him fairly in the eyes. "That
is the second unwise thing you have done," she remarked.
And then: "Evan, there are times when
you are sadly in need of a balance-wheel. Don't<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>
you know that?"</p>

<p>"I knew it a good while ago. I applied for one
once, and it was refused when you said 'No'."</p>

<p>For one who was supposed to be far above and
beyond such emotional signallings, she blushed very
prettily. Which merely proves that one may be a
diplomaed sociologist with a burning zeal for alleviating
the miseries of a sodden world, without having
parted with the primitive sex impulse.</p>

<p>"I am willing to try to help you now," she said,
half hesitating; "if only you won't try to drag me
over into the field of sentiment. It was just a bit
of boyish rage&#8212;fine enough in its way, but foolish&#8212;your
sending that telegram to Mr. McVickar. Can't
you recall it?"</p>

<p>"No; not now."</p>

<p>"Then you must do the next best thing: tell him
you have reconsidered."</p>

<p>"But I haven't reconsidered; I can't and won't
stand in with the corruption and bribery that is going
on all around me!" he objected indignantly.</p>

<p>"Of course you can't; and you mustn't. But
the true reformer doesn't drop things and run away.
You must stay in and fight&#8212;fight harder than you
ever have before, Evan. If you can't do it for the<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>
sake of the larger right, then you must do it for your
own sake. Can't you see the open door before you?"</p>

<p>"I can see and hear and feel when the door is
slammed in my face," was the qualifying rejoinder.
"How can I go on preaching the gospel of cleanness
and fair dealing, when I know that all this
crooked work is going on behind my back? What
will the people of this State say to me and about
me when the crookedness comes to light?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said; "that is just where you begin
to grow one-sided. You must go on preaching the
gospel, but that is only half of the battle. The other
half is to be big enough and strong enough and insistent
enough to make the thing itself agree with
the gospel. I fully believe you lost your best helper
when you refused to join hands with your father.
You don't believe that, so we'll let it go. You have
gone your own way, choosing what seemed to you
to be the better opportunity. Evan, you can't turn
back; you've simply <i>got</i> to go on and wring success
out of apparent failure!"</p>

<p>Blount drew a deep breath and<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a> sat up in his chair.
There was no mistaking the light in Patricia's eyes
now; the pure flame of which it was the visible
radiance is the torch which has kindled the beacon
fires on all the heights since the world began.</p>

<p>"If I had only my own people&#8212;the railroad people&#8212;to
knock down and drag out," he was beginning,
but she broke in warmly:</p>

<p>"You think you have your father against you,
too; I don't believe it, but you do. Very well; then
you must compel him, as well as the others. Be a
big man, Evan; be the biggest man in the State
until you have proved that one man with a righteous
cause is better than ten thousand without it."</p>

<p>Blount got up and stood with his back to the
dying embers of the tiny fire, and if he put his
hands behind him it was because the passionate
impulse to break down all the barriers was twitching
in every fibre of him.</p>

<p>"Patricia, girl, I wonder if you know what you
have done to me? I drove out here this evening
utterly discouraged and disheart<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>ened; bitter and
angry, and ready to throw the whole thing up and
go away. You've changed all that&#8212;you, you know;
just you. Oh, girl, girl! if I could only have you
beside me to give me my battle-word!"</p>

<p>She had her slender fingers locked over one knee
and her eyes were downcast.</p>

<p>"Now you are tempting me," she said slowly;
"and&#8212;and it isn't fair. You know my weakness
and passion to help. You <i>mustn't</i> tempt me, Evan."</p>

<p>What he would have said, with what eager pleadings
he would have pressed the advantage gained
by his appeal for the larger help, is not to be here
set down. For at that moment the bamboo door
curtains parted to admit the small house-mistress.</p>

<p>"You two!" she scolded with light-hearted austerity.
And then to Evan: "Don't you know that
we are keeping country hours here at Wartrace
now? The professor will be up and calling for the
car at six o'clock, and it's past midnight. Shame
on you! Run away and get your beauty sleep&#8212;both
of you!"</p>

<h3>THE LIEGEMAN</h3>


<p><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>Evan Blount drove himself back to the capital
in the swift roadster the following morning, and
there was no opportunity for further confidential
speech with Patricia before he left. But with the
new day had arisen, full-grown, the determination
born in the moment of midnight heart-warming and
inspiration. To the best of his ability he would
live up to the high standard set for him by the
woman he loved, not only preaching the gospel of
fair dealing, but doing his utmost to make it effective.</p>

<p>With this high purpose singing its song of exaltation
in his veins, he drove on past the garage and
made an early call at the office of the traffic manager.
Gantry was in the midst of his morning mail-opening,
but he pushed the desk-load of papers aside
when the door swung inward to admit the early
visitor.</p>

<p>"Hello, old man! Come back to jar me some
more about that telegram?" was his greeting.</p>

<p>Blount shook his head. "No; if you've sent it,
well and good. If you haven't, you may pitch it
into the waste-basket. I came to talk about something
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>else."</p>

<p>"Good, sound, sensible second thought!" Gantry
commented, laughing. Then he took out his
pocket-book and passed the suppressed telegram
across to Blount. "Here it is; you can do the
waste-basket act yourself. I couldn't let you commit
<i>hara-kiri</i> without at least trying to get the cutting
tool out of your hands. What is the other
thing you've got on your mind this early in the
morning? It must be a nightmare of some sort, by
the look in your eyes."</p>

<p>"It may figure as a nightmare to you, Dick, before
we're through with it. I'll make it short. You
know what I have been doing&#8212;what I supposed I
was hired to do&#8212;assuring everybody right and left
that we were going into this campaign with clean
hands?"</p>

<p>"I know," admitted the traffic manager, developing
a sudden interest in the figures of the rug at
his feet.</p>

<p>"I have been doing this in a business way at my
office up-town, in season and out of season, and night
before last, at Ophir, I did it publicly. As the campaign
progr<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>esses, I shall doubtless put myself on
record many times to the same effect."</p>

<p>"Good man!" applauded Gantry, striving to drag
the talk down to some less portentous altitude.
"I'm sure we need all the whitewashing anybody
can give us."</p>

<p>"That is just the point I have come to make,"
Blount went on gravely. "It mustn't be merely a
coat of whitewash, Dick; it has got to be the real
thing, this time. I began by firing the 'little
brothers,' as you called them, but I sha'n't stop at
that; I mean to go higher up if I am compelled to.
I am here this morning to ask you to give me your
word as a gentleman and my friend that you will
not, directly or indirectly, do or cause to be done
anything that will make me stand forth as a self-convicted
liar before the people of this State. I
want you to promise me that you will cut out all
the deals, all the briberies, all the bargainings, all
the&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Oh, say; see here!" protested the man under
fire; "you've got the wrong pig by the ear,
Evan. I'm not the Transcontinental Railway
Company!"</p>

<p>"I know you are not. But, to a greater degree
than any other official<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a> in the local management,
you have Mr. McVickar's confidence. If you don't
feel competent to handle the thing on your own
responsibility, of course it's your privilege to pass
it up to those who have the authority. In that
case, I wish to make one point clear: you're the
man I'm going to hold up to the rack. I can't afford
to spread myself over the entire management,
and I don't mean to try. I'm going to look to you,
Dick, for the backing of the clean sheet, and I warn
you in all soberness that there must be no blots on
it; no compromises; no whipping of the devil around
the stump."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" murmured Gantry. "And you're
on the pay-rolls, the same as the rest of us! But
candidly, as man to man, Evan, the thing can't be
done, you know. We've got to play the game;
they'll eat us alive if we don't. You needn't figure
in it at all; it was a mistake letting Sim Hathaway
get to you, and I said so at the time. But your&#8212;er&#8212;the
powers that be said it had to be that way,
and I had to let him go and ball you all up. It
sha'n't happen again; I can promise you that much,
anyway."</p>

<p>Blount caught quickly at the hesitant pause.</p>

<p>"Who were 'the powers that be' in Hathaway's
case, Dick?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that; honestly, I can't, Evan,"
was the anxious refusal. "Don't ask me."</p>

<p><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>"All right; then I shall assume that Mr. McVickar
was responsible," said Blount calmly, thus proving
that he had not taken his degree in the law school
for nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, hold on! You mustn't do that, either!"
protested the man who was figuring most unwillingly
as the occupant of the witness stand.</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned the postgraduate, with
the true Blount smile. "Now I know that it was
my father. No; you needn't deny it; I suppose it
was for some good reason that this man was sent
to teach me how to play the game&#8212;as reasons go
in practical politics. But we are side-stepping the
real issue. I've asked you for a promise: will you
give it?"</p>

<p>"I&#8212;I can't give it, Evan, and hold my job; that's
God's own truth!"</p>

<p>"No; it isn't God's truth&#8212;it's the other kind.
But that was about what I expected you to say.
Now hear my side of it: if you don't clean house&#8212;you
and the other officials of the company&#8212;I shall
not only resign; I shall take the field on the other
side and tell what I know and why I've thrown up
my job. I've been telling everybody that this is to
be a campaign of publicity, and by all that is good
and great, I shall keep my word, Dick!"</p>
<p><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></p>
<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, you wouldn't do that!"
ejaculated the traffic man, now thoroughly alarmed.
"Land of glory, Evan! you know too much&#8212;a great
deal too much!"</p>

<p>The young man who knew too much got up and
relighted his cigar with a match taken from Gantry's
desk box.</p>

<p>"It's up to you," he said, with his hand on the
door-knob. "Get into communication with whatever
'powers that be' there are that can give the
necessary orders; see to it that the orders are given,
and that they are put in the way of being carried
out. As God hears me, Dick, I mean what I say:
it's a clean sheet, or an exposure that will make a
lot of you wish you had never been born. If I have
to put the screws on&#8212;as I hope and pray I sha'n't&#8212;you
can bet they'll be put on lawyer-fashion; with
evidence that will send a bunch of you to the penitentiary."</p>

<p>"Hold on&#8212;one question before you go, Evan!"
pleaded Gantry. "I haven't known half the time
where I'm at in this latest muddle. Is this another
little blind lead of the Honorable Sen&#8212;of your
father's?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></p>
<p>Blount's smile was as grim as any that Gantry
had ever seen on the face of the Honorable David.</p>

<p>"It's against nature for you to play the game
straight, isn't it, Dick?" he said in mild reproach.
"If you don't know that my father is still the head
of the machine, and that the machine has always
been for you in the past, I imagine you're the
only man in the Sage-Brush State who needs enlightening.
No, Gantry; you've got only one man
to fight; but you mustn't forget that his name, also,
is Blount. Go to it and send me word, and let the
first word be that you have scotched the head of
this lumber-company snake. That's all for to-day.
Good-by."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that his day's work was
still ahead of him, the traffic manager did not attack
it when he was left alone. An able man in his calling,
and one who had fought his way rapidly by sheer
merit and hard work from a clerkship to an official
desk, Richard Gantry was still lacking, in a character
admirable and most lovable in many ways,
the iron that refuses to bend, and&#8212;though perhaps
in lesser measure&#8212;the courage of his ultimate convictions.
In addition to these basic weaknesses he
owned another&#8212;the weakness of the cog which is
constrained to turn with the great wheel of which
it is a part.</p>
<p><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></p>
<p>In his heart of hearts Richard Gantry knew that
Blount was right; knew that the forlorn-hope fight
into which his friend and college classmate had
plunged was a struggle to call out all that was best
and finest in friendly loyalty. But when he sprang
from his chair and began to walk the floor of his
private office with his head down and his hands
deeply buried in his pockets, he was once more the
true corporation liegeman, loyal to his salt, and
anxious only to contrive means to an end.</p>

<p>"Confound his picture!" he muttered, "why the
devil can't he see that he's got everything to lose
and nothing to gain? It's a thousand pities that
such a royal good fellow has to turn himself into a
wild-eyed, impossible crank! The Lord knows, I'd
do anything in reason for him; but I can't let him
turn anarchist and blow us all to kingdom come.
He's got to be muzzled in some way, and I'll be
hanged if I know how it's going to be done."</p>

<p>The pacing monologue paused when the traffic
manager stopped at the window and stood looking
with unseeing eyes upon the morning bustle of
Sierra Avenue. Then he broke out again.</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful tangle&#8212;damn' beautiful! Evan
says I know that we've got the machine with us; I
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>wish to heaven I did know it, and could be sure of
it. That would simplify matters a whole lot. But
the vice-president won't say, and he's the one who
has been doing all the dickering with the Honorable
David. They quarrelled at first; I'd bet every dollar
I've got on that. But I more than half-believe
they've patched it up now, and I believe it was Mr.
McVickar's quick swiping of Evan&#8212;jerking him out
from under his father's thumb the way he did&#8212;that
brought on the peace negotiations."</p>

<p>He turned away from the window and resumed
the floor-pacing, still wrestling with the deductions.</p>

<p>"By George! I believe I've got hold of the end
of the thread at last! The senator <i>is</i> with us, working
in the dark, as he always does. And that Hathaway
business: that was one of his smooth little
side-moves&#8212;his or Mrs. Honoria's. He didn't want
Evan to get in too deep in the righteousness puddle,
and he took that way of letting him get a peek at
the real thing. It was overdone, though; horribly
overdone. Confound it all! I wish Mr. McVickar
would loosen up a little more with me! If he'd tell
me a few of the things I ought to know&#8212;"</p>

<p>The interruption was the entrance of the boy
from the<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a> train-despatcher's office with a verbal message.
The vice-president, moving westward, had
changed his plans and cut out some of his stop-overs.
Car "008" would be in on the noon train
and would proceed westward, running special, at
one o'clock. The despatcher had thought that Mr.
Gantry might want to know.</p>

<p>The traffic manager did want to know, and when
the boy had ducked out, the knowledge was promptly
utilized. A touch of a desk-button brought the
stenographer, and Gantry dictated a message. "'Important
that I should have conference with you on
arrival. Will meet you at train at twelve-three.'
Send that to Mr. McVickar over the despatcher's
wire, and ask Gilkey to rush it," he directed, and
the shorthand man went to do it.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Evan Anarchist Blount!" said Gantry,
apostrophizing the late disturber of his peace, "now
we'll find out just where we're at and how big a rope
it's going to take to snub you down," and thereupon
the desk buzzer rattled again, and Mr. Richard Gantry
squared himself for his forenoon's work.</p>

<p>At the moment of his apostrophizing Blount was
opening his mail in the Temple Court office, and lamenting,
as a loyal friend might, the necessity for
the recent clubbing into line of so fine a fellow as
Dick Gantry. But the mail-opening plunged him
once more into the political actualities. There were
letters from all over the State, and among them
three invitations from widely separated cities, all
based upon the newspaper reports of his Ophir
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>speech. It seemed to be plainly evident that the
"campaign-of-education" idea was striking a popular
chord, and the proponent of the idea saw what
a miraculous opportunity was offering for the railroad
if only the "powers" that Gantry had refused to
name were broad enough and high-minded enough
to seize it.</p>

<p>After a day and an evening well filled with detail,
Blount went to the station to take the nine-thirty
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>west-bound, since the first of the three speaking
engagements&#8212;all of which had been promptly
accepted by wire&#8212;lay in that direction. On the
platform, whither he went to consult the bulletin-board,
he found Gantry.</p>

<p>"Your train is half an hour late," said the traffic
man, with a glance for the travelling-bag in Blount's
hand. "Didn't they know enough at the hotel to
tell you about it?"</p>

<p>"They told me it was on time," said the putative
traveller, and he was far enough from suspecting
that Gantry himself had arranged to have the inaccurate
information given across the counter at the
Inter-Mountain, so that he might be sure of an uninterrupted
half-hour with Blount before he should
leave the city.</p>

<p>"Ump!" said the traffic manager, "I've got to
wait for it, too. One of my men is coming in on it.
Let's go up to the office. It's pleasanter there."</p>

<p>Together they climbed the stair to the second<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>
floor of the station building, and Gantry unlocked
the door of his private room and turned on the
lights.</p>

<p>"Feeling any more humane than you did this
morning?" he inquired genially, after he had opened
his desk and found a box of cigars.</p>

<p>"I haven't been feeling otherwise since&#8212;well,
let's say since midnight last night," countered
Blount laughing.</p>

<p>"Why midnight?"</p>

<p>"That was about the time when I made up my
mind definitely to stay in the fight."</p>

<p>"Then you are still meaning to go ahead on the
lines you laid down this morning?"</p>

<p>"If I wasn't, I shouldn't be here to take the
train for the rally at Angora to-morrow night."</p>

<p>Gantry smoked in silence for a little time. Then
he said: "You can't do it, Evan. It's fine and glorious
and heart-breaking, and all that; but you can't
do it."</p>

<p>"I can, and I will!"</p>

<p>"I say you can't. I know a good bit more now
than I knew this morning!"</p>

<p>"Catalogue it," said B<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>lount tersely.</p>

<p>"Mr. McVickar came in on the noon train to-day,
and I had an interview with him."</p>

<p>"That doesn't tell me anything."</p>

<p>Again the traffic manager took time to smoke and
to reflect.</p>

<p>"You made some pretty savage threats this morning,
Evan; about shoving this thing to the point
where the grand juries, Federal and State, could take
hold of it. As a lawyer, you know even better than
I do what that would mean."</p>

<p>"I told you what it would mean. In the present
state of public sentiment it would mean prison sentences
for every man of you caught with the goods."</p>

<p>"Yes, for every man of us," said Gantry slowly;
"for the railroad man who has given, and for the
other man who has taken. Evan, the jails of this
State wouldn't be big enough to hold us all."</p>

<p>"I can readily believe you. That is the full
weight of the stick with which I am going to club
you fellows into decency."</p>

<p>"And you'll let the club fall wherever it may?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>"I've got to do that, Dick; I can't do any less."</p>

<p>For the third time Gantry paused. The train-waiting
interval was half gone, and he had been
feeling purposefully for the climaxing moment without
finding it. But now he decided that it had
come.</p>

<p>"In the talk this morning there was some reference
made to your father and his attitude in this
fight, Evan. Do you remember what was said?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Well, suppose I should tell you that I know
now&#8212;what I didn't know certainly then&#8212;that when
you hit out at us you hit him?"</p>

<p>"You mean that he is with you in this scheme
to hoodwink the people?"</p>

<p>"Ask yourself," was the low-toned reply.</p>

<p>"I have asked myself a hundred times, Dick;
I've been hoping against hope. I'll be utterly frank
with you, as man to man. We've kept pretty obstinately
out of the political field, both of us, father
and I, since the first day when I told him my views
on machine-made government. But from a few little<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>
things he has said, I've gathered that he isn't with
you; that there has been a quarrel of some kind
between him and Mr. McVickar&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>"There was a set-to&#8212;a battle royal," Gantry put
in. "The last act of it was played to a finish that
evening when Mr. McVickar took you down to his
car and hired you. But there has been a meeting
since. Ask yourself again, Evan. Haven't you had
good and sufficient reasons for believing that you
are bucking, not only the railroad company, but your
own flesh and blood?"</p>

<p>This time it was Blount who took time for reflection.
The shot had gone home. He told himself
that there were only too many reasons for believing
that Gantry was stating the simple fact. None the
less, he made a final effort to break down the conclusion
that Gantry was relentlessly thrusting upon
him.</p>

<p>"In all our talks, Dick&#8212;there haven't been very
many of them&#8212;my father has taken, or seemed to
take, a different line. I don't recall anything specific
just now, but he has given me the impression
that he hasn't much in commo<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>n with Mr. McVickar
and his methods. To hear him talk&#8212;"</p>

<p>Gantry smiled. "You know your father very
superficially, Evan, if you'll permit me to say so.
What the Honorable David Blount says in talk with
you or me or anybody outside of the inner circle is
a mighty poor foundation upon which to build any
idea of what's going on in the back of his head. No&#8212;hold
on; don't get mad. What I'm trying to tell
you is what everybody in the sage-brush hills&#8212;save
and excepting yourself&#8212;knows like a book, and
that is that the big boss's moves are all made strictly
in the dark. He doesn't let his own right hand know
what the left is doing. That's the secret of his absolutely
Czarish power, I think."</p>

<p>The shriek of a distant locomotive whistle floated
in through the open window at Blount's back and
he got up stiffly.</p>

<p>"That's my train coming," he said. And then:
"Tell me plainly, Dick: you brought me up here
to throw a final brick&#8212;a bigger one than you have
yet thrown&#8212;and I know it. What did Mr. McVickar
tell you to-day that will make my job harder
than I am already finding it?"</p><p><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></p>

<p>Gantry turned his head, refusing to meet the
straightforward gaze of the questioner.</p>

<p>"You intimated this morning that you would go
at it lawyer-fashion, Evan," he said; "which means,
I suppose, that you would get the evidence on us.
You can do it; the Lord knows, there's plenty of it
to be had. But when you pull out one set of props
the whole thing will come down. We haven't any
of us been careful enough about what we put in
writing&#8212;<i>not even your father</i>."</p>

<p>Blount staggered as if the words had been a
blow.</p>

<p>"You're trying to tell me that my father would
be involved in the disclosures you fellows might
drive me to make?" he demanded, and his voice was
husky.</p>

<p>Gantry was still looking away. "There always
has to be an intermediary&#8212;you know that. We
can't do business direct with these&#8212;with the people
who have something to sell. You can draw your
own inferences, Evan. I didn't send Hathaway to
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>you; I sent him to your father."</p>

<p>The train was thundering into the station and
Blount picked up his hand-bag and went out, stumbling
blindly in the unlighted passage at the stair-head.
And in the private office behind him the
traffic manager was crushing his dead cigar in his
clenched hand and staring fixedly at the square of
darkness framed by the open window.</p>

<h3>BARRIERS INVISIBLE</h3>


<p>During the three weeks following the night journey
to Angora, a journey on which he once more
fought the hard battle to a still sharper conclusion,
Evan Blount scarcely saw his office in Temple Court
for more than a brief hour or two at a time. One
speaking appointment followed another in such rapid
succession that he was constantly going or returning;
and since there was everywhere a repetition
of the welcome accorded him by the miners of the
Carnadine district, there was no reason save physical
weariness to make him wish to limit his opportunity.</p>

<p>It was not until he was deep into the fourth we<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>ek
of the hurryings to and fro that he began to admit
a suspicion which grew like a juggler's rose once he
had given it place. Could it be possible that these
numerous invitations, coming now from all parts
of the State, were purely spontaneous? If not, if
they were so many subtle moves in the great game,
he could see no possible end to be subserved by
them save one: they were effectually keeping him
away from the capital, which was naturally the nucleus
and centre of the campaign activities. Was
there something going on at headquarters that "the
powers" did not wish him to find out? Of one
thing he was well assured. Gantry was dodging
him, was apparently keeping an accurate record
of his movements; for whenever the hurryings permitted
a flying return to the capital the traffic
manager was always out of town.</p>

<p>These were small matters, but vital in their way.
Failing to keep in touch with Gantry, Blount could
never be sure that the policy of the railroad
company had been reformed or changed in any respect.
Moreover, his journeyings, which brought him in
direct contact with the voters themselves, seemed
to have the effect of isolating him curiously in the
actual battle-field. That a hot political campaign
was raging throughout the length and breadth of
the State was not to be doubted; the newspapers
were full of it, and in man<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>y districts the fight had
become acrimonious and bitter. But although he
was supposed to be in the thick of the fight, he knew
that he was not; that some mysterious influence was
shutting him out and holding him at arm's length.</p>

<p>Everywhere he went the cordial reception, the
attentive and hospitable committeemen, the packed
house, and the generous applause were always awaiting
him. It was as if his progress had been carefully
prearranged, like a sort of triumphal procession.
None the less, the invisible barrier&#8212;the
barrier which was excluding him from a hand-to-hand
grapple with the inner workings of the campaign&#8212;was
always there, and he could neither surmount
it nor push it aside.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hard work and hard travelling,
he did not allow the missionary effort and its
curious isolation to obscure in any sense the sturdier
purpose. By every means he could devise he was
holding his principals up to the mirror of a vigilant
watchfulness. Arguing that the opposition newspapers
would be quick to seize upon any charge of
corruption involving the railroad company, he read
them faithfully. As yet there had been only innuendoes
and a raking over of past misdeeds, though
by this time many of the editors were openly claiming
that the old alliance between the railroad and
the machine had never been broken, and warning
their readers accordingly<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>.</p>

<p>Blount winced when he read such editorials as
these. Though he was going about, striving to do
his part manfully, and even with enthusiasm, the
burden of the cruel responsibility he had voluntarily
shouldered was never less than crushing. His
only hope lay in success. If he could make Gantry
and his superiors come clean-handed to the election,
there need be no exposure, no cataclysm involving
both the railroad officials and his father.</p>

<p>So ran the saving hope; and not content with
mere watchfulness, Blount tried to get his finger
upon the pulse of occasions whenever he could. On
his brief stop-overs in the capital he kept his eyes
and ears open for the earliest hint of any charge
of chicanery, and though he was unable to get hold
of Gantry personally, he kept up a steady fire of
letters and telegrams, all pointing to the same end&#8212;absolute
and utter good faith, and the upholding
of his hands in the public plea for a square deal.
To these the traffic manager always replied guardedly
and optimistically. Everybody was delighted
with the good work done, and doing, by the railroad
company's field manager; public opinion was slowly
but surely changing; let the good work go on&#8212;and
much more to the same effect.</p>
<p><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></p>
<p>Blount did let the good work go on; but as the
critical pre-election weeks approached, he began to
arm himself, reluctantly but resolutely. A little
quiet investigation, which was made to dovetail
cleverly with his speech-making journeys, revealed&#8212;as
Gantry had confessed it would&#8212;convincing
evidence of past corruption and present law-breaking.
Hathaway had told the truth when he had
asserted that his own involvement was only one of
many similar bargains. Blount called upon the
president of the Irrigation Alliance at Romero, in
the heart of the agricultural district, upon the managers
of several of the electric-power companies, and
upon a number of influential mining men&#8212;all shippers,
and all large employers of labor. It was the
same story everywhere. Preferential freight rates
had been given in return for votes controlled, and
the rates were still in effect.</p>

<p>The investigator turned sick at heart when these
men talked quite freely to him, thus showing conclusively
that they were cynically discounting his
public utterances. McDarragh, owner and manager
of the "Wire-Gold" properties in the Moscow
district, winked slyly when Blount cautiously inserted
the probe.</p>

<p>"You're on, Mr. Blount. I sat up there in the
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>Op'ry-house last night listening to your game, and
says I to myself, 'Thim railroad shift-bosses know
their trade.' 'Twas a gr-reat talk you gave us, and
it'll make the swinging of the har-rd-rock vote as
easy as twice two. Of course, we have a thin paring
on the ore rate; you'll be knowing that as well as
annybody in the game, I'm thinking. 'Tis well that
we fellows at the top know how to make one hand
wash the other. Come again, Mr. Blount, and give
my regards to the sinator when ye see him. And
ye might whisper in his ear that it's a waste of good
wor-rk for him to be sinding his gum-shoe wire-pullers
to be laboring with our min. We're safe as
the clock up here in the Moscow."</p>

<p>This was not the first hint that Blount had been
given pointing to the underground work of the machine.
That this work was being directed toward
the subversion of the popular will, he made no doubt;
and there were times when he was strongly tempted
to carry the war boldly into the wider field of graft
and bossism. That he postponed the bigger battle
was due quite as much to the singleness of purpose
which was his best gift as to the desire to spare his
father. Telling himself resolutely that the reformation
of the railroad company's political methods was
his chief object, and the only one which warranted
him in retaining his place on the Company's payrolls,
he held aloof when his father's n<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>ame was mentioned
and bent himself to the task of providing the
means for the subjugation of Gantry&#8212;and of Gantry's
and his own superiors, if need be.</p>

<p>The securing of evidence of the kind which would
really give him the whip-hand promised to be a
delicate undertaking. Men like McDarragh talked
openly enough about the illegal special freight rates,
but talk was not evidence. Curiously enough, while
he was trying to devise some way of obtaining the
tangible proof without using his semiofficial position
in the company's service as a lever, the thing
itself was thrown at him. From some mysterious
source a rumor went out that the special rates were
in jeopardy; and the very men with whom he had
talked began to write him importunate letters begging
him to deny the rumor. With a sheaf of these
letters in his pocket, each one inculpating both parties
to the illegal "deals," Blount grew gayly exultant.
The natural inference was that Gantry and
"the powers" had been finally forced to yield&#8212;that
he had won his victory. But if he had not yet won
it, chance, or something better, had placed in his
hands the weapon with which he could compel a
return to fair dealing and honesty.</p>

<p>It was on a second speech-making visit to Ophir
that Blount had his first<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a> face-to-face chance at Gantry.
A meeting of the Mine-Owners' Association,
moving for a readjustment of the classification on
copper matte and bullion at a time when the railroad
company might be supposed to be on the giving
hand, brought Gantry to the gold camp in the
Carnadine Hills, and the first man he met at the
hotel was the stubborn dictator of new policies for
the Transcontinental Company.</p>

<p><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>"Hello, Dick! made a mistake, didn't you&#8212;coming
while I was here?" said the reformer, with
a very lifelike replica of his father's grim smile.
"I suppose you have an immediate engagement to
go somewhere else, or to do something that will give
you a chance to dodge?"</p>

<p>"No; I wish to the Lord I had!" was the hearty
admission. "You're a fright, Evan; you are getting
to be a perfect nightmare, with your letters and
telegrams. You've got me so I'm afraid to open
my desk."</p>

<p>Blount nodded gravely. "I'm glad the letters
and telegrams have had their effect at last," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Had their effect? Yes, they've had the effect
of turning my hair gray, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"I think you know what I mean, Dick."</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I do. What are you driving at?"</p>

<p>"At the fact that you have finally concluded to
cancel the crooked deals with&#8212;wait, and I'll <a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>give
you the names of the co-respondents"&#8212;and he drew
a packet of neatly docketed letters from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," protested the traffic manager;
"you're getting in rather too deep for me.
Will you let me see those letters?"</p>

<p>Blount put the letters back into his pocket and
mechanically buttoned his light top-coat over them
for additional safety.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you haven't passed
the word to Hathaway and McDarragh and a dozen
others I could name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I haven't. You call yourself a lawyer,
and yet you ask us to set aside promises that
are, or ought to be, as binding as so many written
contracts with penalties attached. You're crazy,
Evan; it can't be done, and that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>Blount was frowning thoughtfully. "'Can't' goes
out of the window when 'must' comes in at the door,
Dick. You remember what I told you&#8212;that I'd
get evidence, lawyer-fashion. I've got it; evidence
of the sort that would turn the people of this State
into a howling mob to tear up your tracks if I should
publish it."</p>

<p>"But I tell you we <i>can't</i> withdraw the specials,
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>you wild-eyed fanatic!"</p>

<p>"All right; then level down the public's rates to
fit them. And do it quickly, old man. The time
is growing fearfully short, and my patience isn't
what it used to be."</p>

<p>"My Lord! anybody would think you owned the
Transcontinental Company, lock, stock, and barrel!
Where under heaven did you get your nerve, Evan?
Blest if I don't believe you could out-bluff the old&#8212;er&#8212;your
father, himself, if you once got the fool
notion into your head that it was your duty to try!"</p>

<p>"You are side-stepping again, Dick, and that
won't go any longer. You've got to fish or cut
bait, and do one or the other pretty soon."</p>

<p>"I'd cut the bait all right, if I were Mr. McVickar,
Evan. I'd fire you so blamed far that you
wouldn't be able to find your way back in a month
of Sundays."</p>

<p>Blount tapped his pocket. "As long as I have
these documents, Mr. McVickar doesn't dare to
fire me. And if you and he don't come down within
the next few days&#8212;yes, it's a matter of days, now&#8212;I'll
fire myself and go over every foot of the ground
again, telling what I know."</p>

<p><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>Gantry's eyes darkened. He had graduated with
honors from the particular department in railroading
in which patience is more than a virtue. Yet
there are limits.</p>

<p>"You seem to have entirely forgotten that little
talk we had in my office the night you were going
to Angora," he said.</p>

<p>"No; I haven't forgotten it&#8212;not for a single
waking minute."</p>

<p>"What I said to you then goes as it lies," was the
threatening reminder. "If you pull the props out,
there'll be more than one death in the family."</p>

<p>"You mean that you, or Mr. McVickar, will make
it a point to include my father; I've wrestled that
out, too, Dick. I'm going to try to pull him out
of it, but whether I succeed or fail, the consequences
will be the same for you fellows. Come and hear
me speak to-night, Dick&#8212;if you're stopping over
that long. Then you'll know how much in earnest&#8212;how
deadly in earnest&#8212;I am. You spoke of my
father just now; I want to remind you again that
I, too, bear the Blount name&#8212;a name that I have
heard bandied about as a synonym for all that is
worst in our political life. Don't you see that I've
got to make good?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></p>
<p>"Oh, great cats!&#8212;you and your high-strung notions
of what you've got to do!" snorted the traffic
manager, and he went away to his classification
meeting.</p>

<h3>SWORD-PLAY</h3>


<p>It was during this hard-travelling period that
Blount saw, with keen regret, the gradual widening
of the breach between his father and himself. In
their infrequent meetings there was never anything
remotely approaching an open rupture; but in a
thousand ways the younger man fancied he could
see and feel the steady growth of the rift.</p>

<p>That the long arm of the machine of which his
father was the acknowledged head was reaching out
into all corners of the State, was a fact no longer to
be doubted, and that the influences thus set in motion
were sinister, he took for granted. Therefore,
when it came in his way, he scored the machine
frankly, charging it with much of the mischief which
had been wrought in the way of arousing public
sentiment against the corporations. "The worst in
politics joined with the worst elements in capital<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>ized
industry," was his platform characterization of
the alliances of the past, and he usually added that
he was fighting it as every honest man was in duty
bound to fight it. But it is hard to fight in the
dark. After all was said, he could not help admiring
the subtlety of the master brain which was able
to control and direct such a complicated piece of
human mechanism; direct it so skilfully and cleverly
that, though the name of the thing was in everybody's
mouth, its workings were so carefully concealed
that it was only by the merest chance that
he stumbled upon them now and then.</p>

<p>In more than one of the short stop-overs in the
capital he had found his father still occupying the
private suite at the Inter-Mountain, and now and
again there was a meal shared in the more or less
crowded <i>café</i>. On such occasions the son leaned
heavily upon the public character of the place and
carefully steered the table-talk&#8212;or thought he did&#8212;into
innocuous channels. But on a day shortly
after the meeting with Gantry in Ophir this desultory
programme was broken. Reaching the hotel
in the evening after an all-day train journey from
Lewiston, Blount found his father waiting for him
in the lobby, and when he proposed a <i>café</i> dinner
the senator shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, son; not this evening," he sai<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>d. "I've
been feeling sort of set up and aristocratic to-day,
and I've just ordered a dinner sent upstairs. I
reckon you'll join me?"</p>

<p>The young man was willing enough; more than
willing, since he was now ready to say a thing which
must be said before he could be prepared to set a
time limit upon Gantry&#8212;a limit beyond which lay
the firing of the fuse and the blowing up of all
things mundane.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he agreed. "Give me a few minutes
to change my clothes&#8212;"</p>

<p>"You look good enough to me just as you are,
boy," said the dinner-giver, and he took his son by
the arm and walked him to the elevator.</p>

<p>In the private dining-room Blount found the table
laid for two, much as if his coming had been pre-figured.
He let that go, and for the time the talk
was of the doings at Wartrace Hall: of the professor's
enthusiastic digging for fossils, of Patricia's
keen enjoyment of the life in the open, and&#8212;this
put with gentle hesitation on the part of the news-bringer&#8212;of
Mrs. Honoria's growing affection for
the young woman whose ambitions reached out toward
a sociological career.</p>

<p><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>"You say Patricia is learning to drive a car?"
queried Patricia's lover.</p>

<p>"Best woman driver I ever saw," was the senator's
praiseful rejoinder. "Nothing feazes that little
girl, and I'm telling you that she can turn the wheels
just about as fast as you want to ride."</p>

<p>This was a new aspect of Miss Anners, even to
one who knew her as well as Blount thought he
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>knew her, and, lover-like, he found a grain of encouragement
in it. Patricia had never cared for the
out-of-door things save as they bore upon the hygienic
condition of the poor in the great cities. If
she had changed in one respect, she might change
in another.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know that," he commented. "She
was needing an outlet on that side. There is a good
bit of the Puritan in her&#8212;all work and no play, you
know."</p>

<p>The senator looked out from beneath his shaggy
eyebrows. "Speaking of work; they're working
you pretty hard these days, aren't they, son? If
you belonged to my generation instead of your own,
you wouldn't be cold-shouldering that young woman
out yonder at Wartrace the way you do; not for
all the politics that were ever hatched."</p>

<p>"I have my work to do, and Patricia Anners would
be the last person in the world to put obstacles in
the way of it," returned the son gravely. Then he
added: "I wish I could say as much for other<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>
people."</p>

<p>The boss shot another keen glance across the
table. "Somebody been trying to block you, Evan,
boy?" he asked.</p>

<p>Blount met the gaze of the shrewd gray eyes
without flinching.</p>

<p>"I don't know of any good reason why we
shouldn't be entirely frank with each other, dad,"
he said, using for the first time since his return to
the homeland the old boyhood father-name. "You
know, better than any one else, I think, what the
stumbling-blocks are, and who is putting them in
my way."</p>

<p>"Maybe so; maybe I do," was the even-toned
answer. "It happens so, once in a while, that I
know a heap of things I can't tell, son." Then:
"Has McVickar been calling you down?"</p>

<p>"No one has called me down. But some one, or
something, is keeping me out of the real fight. I
don't mean that I'm not doing w<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>hat I set out to do:
I've got my own particular abomination by the
neck, and I'm about to choke the life out of it. But
that is, as you might say, a side issue. The real
struggle is going on all around me, but I'm not in
it or of it. Everywhere I go there is the same
cut-and-dried welcome, the same predetermined enthusiasm.
Sometimes it seems as if all the people I
meet have been instructed to make things pleasant
and easy for me."</p>

<p>The senator's chuckle was barely audible.</p>

<p>"Seems as if I wouldn't find fault with that, if I
were you, son," he suggested. "You are like the
boy who has found a good piece of skating over a
sheet of fine, smooth ice, and takes to complaining
because it won't break and let him down into the
cold water. You'll get enough of the real thing by
and by."</p>

<p>Evan Blount felt his anger rising. He was in
precisely the right mood to construe the gentle jest
into an admission that his father, failing to make
him a cog in one of the wheels of the machine, had
gone about in some mysterious way to insulate him&#8212;to
make it impossible for him to get into the real
tide of affairs. But he kept his temper, in a measure,
at least.</p>

<p>"I guess it's no use for us to try to get together,"
he said with a tang of abruptness in his tone. "We
are diametrically opposed to each other at every
point, you and I, dad. I stand for democracy, the
will of the people and its fullest and freest expression.
You stand for&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Well, son, what do I stand for?" queried the
father, and the question was put with a quizzical
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>smile that brought the hot blood boyishly to Blount's
cheeks.</p>

<p>"If I should say what all men say&#8212;what some of
them are frank enough to say even to me&#8212;" he
stopped short, and then went on with better
self-control: "Let's keep the peace if we can, dad."</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon we can do that," was the good-natured
rejoinder. "Being on the railroad side, yourself,
you can't help feeling sort of hostile at the rest
of us, I reckon."</p>

<p>Blount put his knife and fork down and straightened
himself in his chair.</p>

<p>"There it is again, you see. We can't get together
even on a question of admitted fact! Do
you suppose for a single minute, dad, that I've been
going up and down, and around and about, all these
weeks without finding out that the old alliance of
the machine with the very element in the railroad
policy that I am fighting is still in existence?"</p>

<p>The senator was nodding soberly. "So you've
found that out, too, have you?" he commented.</p>

<p>"I have, and I wish that were the worst of it, but
it isn't, dad. There's a thing behind the alliance
that cuts deeper than anything else I've had to face."</p>

<p>Once more the deep-set eyes looked out from their
bushy penthouses. "Reckon you could give it a
name, son?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>"Yes; when you found that I wasn't going to let
you run me for the attorney-generalship, you arranged
with Mr. McVickar to have me put on the
railroad pay-roll. Isn't that the fact?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," said the senator, and a grim smile
went with the qualified denial. "It was sort of the
other way round. I reckon McVickar thought he
was putting one across on me when he offered you
the railroad job and got you to take it."</p>

<p>"I know; that was at first. You and he couldn't
come to terms because you&#8212;because the machine
wanted more than he was willing to give. But
afterward there was another meeting and you got
together. That part of it was all right, if you see
it that way. What broke my heart was the fact
that you and he agreed to put me up as a fence
behind which all the crookedness and rascality of a
corrupt campaign could be screened."</p>

<p>In the pause which followed, a deft waiter slipped
in to change the courses. When the man was gone,
Blount went on.</p>

<p>"It came mighty near smashing me when I found
it out, dad. It wasn't so much the thing itself as
it was the thought that you'd do it&#8212;the thought
that you had forgotten that I was a Blount, and
your son."</p>
<p><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></p>
<p>Again the older man nodded gravely. "How
come you to find out, Evan, boy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It was when Hathaway had been given his
chance at me. He opened the cesspool for me, as
you meant he should when you sent him to me.
From your point of view, I suppose it was necessary
that I should be shown. You knew what I was
saying and doing; how I was taking it for granted
that the railroad was going in clean-handed, and the
one ray of comfort in the whole miserable business
is the fact that you cared enough to want to give
me a glimpse of the real thing that was hiding behind
all my brave talk. But I don't think you
counted fully upon the effect it would have upon me."</p>

<p>"What was the effect, son?"</p>

<p>"At first, it made me want to throw up the fight
and run away to the ends of the earth. It seemed
as if I didn't have anybody to turn to. You were
in it, and Gantry was in it&#8212;and Gantry's superiors
and mine. That evening I borrowed one of your
cars and drove out to Wartrace. I meant to have
it out with you, and then to throw up my hands
and quit."</p>

<p>"But you didn't do either one," said the father
<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>tentatively.</p>

<p>"No. Nothing went right that day, until just at
the last. When I was about to give up and go to bed,
Patricia came into the smoking-room. I had to
talk to somebody, so I talked to her; told her where
I had landed."</p>

<p>"And she advised you to throw up your hands?"</p>

<p>"You don't know Patricia. She put a heart into
my body and blood into my veins. What she said
to me that night is what has kept me going, dad&#8212;what
has made me drive this fight for a clean election
on the part of the railroad company home to
the hilt. I have driven it home. There will be no
crooked deals on the part of the railroad company
this time."</p>

<p>The senator looked up quickly. "That's a mighty
good stout thing to say," he remarked, adding: "I
reckon you're not saying it without having the right
and proper club hid out somewhere where you can
lay hands on it?"</p>

<p>Blount tapped his coat-pocket. "I have the club
right here&#8212;documentary evidence that will rip <a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>this
State wide open and send a lot of people to the penitentiary.
I've told Gantry to pass the word: a
clean sheet, or I go over to the other side and tell
what I know. And that brings me to the thing that
I've got to say to you, dad&#8212;the thing that made me
hope I'd find you here to-night. After I'd got my
battle-word from Patricia, I had a jolt that was
worse than the other. When I pulled the gun on
Gantry, he told me that I couldn't shoot without
killing you; that you were just as deeply involved
as any one of the railroad officials. Is that the
truth?"</p>

<p>The senator had pushed his chair back and was
burying his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"You've come to try to haul me out of the fire?"
he inquired, ignoring the direct question.</p>

<p>"I've come to ask you, first, if it is possible for
you to stand from under. Can you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I reckon I could dodge, if I had to."</p>

<p>"Then do it, and do it quickly, dad! As there is
a God above us, I'm going to push this thing through
to the bitter end. To-morrow morning I shall give
Gantry his time limit. If the time goes by, leaving
the house-cleaning still undone, I shall keep my
promise to the letter. You know, and I know, what
will happen a<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>fter that."</p>

<p>"Yes; I reckon I know," was the half-absent
reply.</p>

<p>Blount threw his napkin aside and glanced at his
watch.</p>

<p>"I've got to go back to the office and work a
while," he said. And then: "I feel better for having
had this talk with you, dad. I'm sorry you are
finding it necessary to fight me, and a thousand times
sorrier that I've got to fight you. But I can't give
ground now, and still be a man and your son. Think
it over and dodge. It'll break my heart a second
time if I have to pull the other fellow's house down
and bury you in the wreck."</p>

<p>For some little time after his son had left the
table and the private dining-room, the Honorable
Senator Sage-Brush sat absently toying with his
dessert-spoon. When he rose to go out, the battle
light in the gray eyes was the signal which not even
his most faithful henchmen could always interpret;
but it was a signal which all of them knew by sight,
and one which many of them feared.</p>

<h3>THE SAFE-BLOWER</h3>


<p>About the time that Evan Blount was finishing
the fourth week of the campaign of education, the
senator's wife began to detect signs of country weariness
in the eyes of Miss Patricia Anners.</p>

<p>"When you are tired of the out-door bignesses,
you have only to say the word," she told the professor's
daughter one morning after they had driven
to Lost River Canyon and back in the small car.
"As you have doubtless discovered, the senator and
I live either here or at the capital indifferently during
the season, and we shall be only too glad to
entertain you in town whenever you feel like going."</p>

<p>To similar proposals made earlier Miss Anners
had always returned prompt refusals. But for a
week or more some impulse which she had not taken
the trouble to analyze seemed to be drawing her toward
the city. The mesa roads were just as inviting,
and the free pleasures of motoring, in a country where
speed restrictions were conspicuous only by their
absence, were just as keen. But no<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>w Patricia confessed
to a restless longing for the sight of city streets
and the brabble of city noises.</p>

<p>"Only you mustn't consider us, or me, so much
as you do, Mrs. Blount," she protested. "I have
a dreadful suspicion that we have already interfered
shamefully with your autumn plans. You are
simply too kind and too hospitable to admit it."</p>

<p>"You have interfered with nothing," was the
ready assurance. "We were not going anywhere,
or thinking of going anywhere. No inducement
that was ever invented would take the senator away
from his own State in a political year, and your
coming has been a blessing. But for the good excuse
to bring your father out here to the fossil-beds,
we should have been mewed up in the Inter-Mountain
Hotel from the firing of the opening gun to the
day after election. But that isn't what I meant to
say. You are tired of so much country; I can read
the call of the city in your eyes&#8212;and they are very
pretty eyes, my dear. Shall I telephone the senator
that we are coming in this afternoon to stay
a while?"</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said Patricia, and the eyes,
which were not only pretty but exceedingly apt to
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>tell tales, confirmed the eager assent. Then she
added: "Now that daddy has his box of books
from the university library, I doubt if he will know
that we are gone."</p>

<p>On their first day in the capital Evan was away,
but he returned the following morning and Mrs.
Blount promptly captured him for a theatre box-party
which she was inviting for the same evening.
In Mrs. Honoria's orderly scheme Blount was predestined
to go, though he was allowed to believe that
his acceptance was of free will. Notwithstanding
the lapse of time and Mrs. Honoria's uniform kindness,
he was still unreasonably prejudiced, and with
the prejudice he was now admitting a feeling akin
to jealousy. It was evident that Patricia's admiration
for his father extended over to his father's wife;
and meaning consistently to dislike Mrs. Honoria,
he was irrational enough to want Patricia to dislike
her, too.</p>

<p>The box-party proved to be a more formal affair
than he had anticipated, since it was large enough
to fill two of the open dress-circle boxes. Gantry
was included, and so were the Weatherfords&#8212;father,
mother, daughters, and son. These, with the Gordons
and a Denver man whose name of Critchett
Blount was not quite sure that he caught in the
introduction, filled Mrs. Honoria's list. In the seating
Blount meant to make sure of having a measurably
undisturbed evening with Patricia. But fate,<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>
or a designing hostess, intervened, and he found
himself cornered between Mrs. Weatherford and her
younger daughter, with the square-shouldered "Paramounter"
candidate for governor strengthening the
barrier which separated him from Miss Anners.</p>

<p>Blount had met Gordon socially a number of
times, and in the intervals allowed him by Mrs.
Weatherford he was silently studying the face of
the big man who, singularly enough, as the student
thought, was thus identifying himself publicly as a
friend of the boss. True, Blount did not forget his
father's warm commendation of Gordon in that earliest
political talk on the Quaretaro Canyon road,
but that was before the lines had been drawn and the
gage of battle thrown down by the allied forces of
the machine and the railroad. Now, with the battle
drawing to its close, Blount thought that nothing
could be more certain than the fact that his father
and his father's organization were joining hands with
the railroad oligarchy to slaughter Gordon at the
polls.</p>

<p>Putting aside the wonder that Gordon should be<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>
accepting Mrs. Honoria's hospitality, Blount fell to
contrasting the strong, large-featured face of the Mission
Hills ranchman with that of Reynolds, the opposition
candidate. Though he was himself on the corporation
campaigning staff, Blount could not help
admitting that the comparison was not favorable to
Reynolds. His first impression of the round-faced,
portly gentleman who was standing firmly upon what
he was pleased to call a platform of law and order&#8212;a
man who was Gordon's opposite in every feature and
characteristic&#8212;had been unfavorable. He had been
saying to himself, since, that Reynolds's face, in spite
of its heavy jaw and prominent eyes, was the face
of a time-server.</p>

<p>Another point of difference between the two men
counted for much. Reynolds wanted the office, and
was spending money liberally to get it, while Gordon
had accepted the nomination reluctantly.
Throughout the hot campaign he had refused to
stump the State for himself or his party, and was
said to be holding steadfastly aloof in the bargaining
and dickering. Weighing the two men one
against the other&#8212;Reynolds was sitting in an adjacent
box with Kittredge and Bentley and two
other railroad officials&#8212;Blount admitted a twinge
of regret that chance, or his convictions, had <a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>made
him a partisan of the weaker.</p>

<p>Having been lost in the shuffle, as he expressed it,
Blount made the most of these reflective excursions
during the period of the box-party captivity. From
the rising of the curtain to the going down thereof
the Weatherfords, mother and daughter, kept him
from exchanging so much as a word with Patricia,
whom Gantry was shamelessly monopolizing. But
on the short return walk to the hotel, Blount asserted
his rights and gave Patricia his arm.</p>

<p>"I think you owe me an abject apology," was the
way she began on him, when they had gained such
privacy as the crowded sidewalk conferred.</p>

<p>"Consider it made, and then tell me what for,"
he rejoined, striving, man-fashion, to catch step
with her mood.</p>

<p>"For making us leave that dear, delightful, out-of-date,
and out-of-place Georgian mansion in the
hills and come to town when we want to get a sight
of your face."</p>

<p>"If anybody else should say a thing like that, I'd
blush and call it a compliment," he retorted.<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a> Her
near presence seemed to lift the burden he was carrying,
and it was good to be light-hearted again, if
only for the passing moment.</p>

<p>"It wasn't meant for a compliment," she returned,
with the straightforward sincerity which Blount had
always been fond of likening to a cup of cold water
on a thirsty day. "Consider a moment. You come
to me with a really harrowing story of your new
experiences, and just as I am beginning to get interested
we are interrupted. In the morning, at
some perfectly impossible hour, off you go, and we
hear no more of you for weeks and weeks. What
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"I have been doing precisely what you told me
to do; preaching the gospel of honesty and fair dealing,
and trying my level best to make other people
practise it."</p>

<p>"You have been successful?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Reasonably so in the preaching, since that depended
solely upon me. As to the other, I don't
know. Sometimes I'm credulous enough to believe
that the house-cleaners are honestly at work, as they
say they are, and at other times I'm afraid they are
only putting up a bluff to mislead me. Some day,
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>perhaps, I may tell you how far I have had to go
into the 'practical-politics' armory to get my
weapons."</p>

<p>There was still a half-square of the sidewalk privacy
available, and she made what seemed to be
the most necessary use of it.</p>

<p>"And your father, Evan; are you coming to understand
him any better?"</p>

<p>He shook his head despondently. "No; or rather
yes. I might say that I am coming to understand
him&#8212;or his methods&#8212;only too well. The only way
we can keep from quarrelling now is to banish politics
when we are together."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said, and the sorrow was emphatic
in her tone. "As I have said before, you
don't understand him. You are judging him by
standards which, however just and true they may
be, are peculiarly<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a> your own standards. I know you
can be broad for others when you try. Can't you
be broad for him?"</p>

<p>It was good to hear her defend his father. It was
what he would have wished his wife to do. Suddenly
there arose within him a huge reluctance to lessen
or to weaken in any way her trust in David Blount.</p>

<p>"Let us say that the fault is mine," he interposed
hastily. "God forbid that I should be the means
of making you think less of him in any respect."</p>

<p>"You couldn't do that, Evan. He is simply a
grand old man&#8212;the first I have ever known for whom
the hackneyed phrase seemed to have been made,"
she asserted warmly. "If he has faults, I am sure
they are nothing more than gigantic virtues&#8212;the
faults of a man who is too strong and too magnanimous
to be little in any respect."</p>

<p>The final half-square lay behind them, and Mrs.
Honoria and the senator, Gantry, Gordon and his
wife, and the two Weatherfords, with one of the
marriageable daughters, were at the <i>café</i> door waiting
for the laggards. Being in no proper frame of
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>mind to enjoy a theatre supper with another Weatherford
attack as the possible penalty, Blount reluctantly
surrendered Patricia to Gantry, made his excuses,
and went to smoke a bedtime pipe in the homelike
and democratic lobby.</p>

<p>With Patricia in town the "silver-tongued spellbinder
of Quaretaro Mesa," as <i>The Daily Capital</i>
called the railroad company's campaign field-officer,
would have been glad to evade some of the speaking
appointments; but since his engagements had
been made some days in advance, he was obliged to go.</p>

<p>On his return to the capital he was delighted to
find the party of three still occupying the private
dining-room suite at the Inter-Mountain. Arriving
on a morning train, he was permitted to make
the party of three a party of four at the breakfast-table;
and with Patricia sitting opposite he was able
to forget the strenuosities for a restful half-hour.</p>

<p>Later, when he went to his offices in the Temple
Court Building, the strenuosities reasserted themselves
with emphasis. Though he found his desk
closed, and was reasonably certain that he had in
his pocket the only key that would unlock it, he
found his papers scattered in confusion under the
roll-top. A touch upon the electric button brought
the stenographer from the anteroom.</p>

<p>"Who's been into my desk, Collins?" he demanded,
pointing to the confusion and scrutinizing
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>the face of the young man sharply for signs of guilt.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious! How could anybody get
into it when you've got the only key, Mr. Blount?"
stammered the clerk. Then he went on, parrot-like:
"I've been putting the letters and telegrams through
the letter-slit, as you told me to, and I've kept the
private office locked."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is very evident that somebody
has been here," said Blount. Then he had a sudden
shock and wheeled shortly upon the stenographer.
"Collins, what did you do with that packet of papers
I gave you last Monday&#8212;the one I told you to put
away in the safe?"</p>

<p>"I did just what you told me to; put it in the
inner cash-box, and put the key of the cash-box on
your desk. Didn't you get it?"</p>

<p>Blount felt in his pockets and found the key, which
he handed to Collins. "Go and get that packet and
bring it to me," he directed. The shock was beginning
to subside a little by now, and he sat down to
bring something like order out of the confusion on
the desk. At first, he had thought that the sheaf
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>of evidence letters which gave him the strangle-hold
upon Gantry and the lawbreakers had been left in
a pigeonhole of the desk. Then he remembered having
given it to Collins to put away.</p>

<p>A minute or two later it occurred to him that the
stenographer was taking a long time for a short errand.
Rising silently, he crossed the room and
reached for the knob of the door of communication.
In the act he saw that the door was ajar, and
through the crack he saw Collins standing before
the opened safe. The clerk was running his tongue
along the flap of a large envelope, preparatory to
sealing it. Blount's first impulse was to break in
with a sharp command. Then he reconsidered and
went back to his desk; was still busy at it when
Collins came in and laid the freshly sealed envelope
before him.</p>

<p>"That isn't the packet I gave you," said Blount
curtly.</p>

<p>The clerk looked away. "You meant those letters,
didn't you?" he queried. "The rubber band
broke and I put them in an envelope."</p>

<p>"When?" snapped Blount.</p>

<p><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>The young man faced around again and the innocence
in his look disarmed the questioner.</p>

<p>"When? Just now. That's what made me so
long&#8212;I couldn't find an envelope big enough."</p>

<p>Blount took up the letter opener and slipped the
blade under the flap of the envelope. If he had
looked up at the stenographer then he would have
seen the mask of innocence slip aside to discover a
face ashen with terror. But whatever the shorthand
man had to fear from the opening of the lately
sealed envelope was postponed by the incoming of
Ackerton, the working head of the legal department,
with a damage suit to discuss with his chief. Blount
thrust the big envelope into his pocket unopened,
and later in the day, when he went around to his
bank to put the evidence letters into his safe-deposit
box, the incident of the morning had lost its
significance so completely, or had been so deeply
buried under other and more important matters,
that he deposited the packet without examining it.</p>

<p>The evening of this same day there was a dance
given by the Gordons in the ranchman candidate's
big house opposite the Weatherfords' in Mesa Circle,
and Blount went, hoping that Patricia would be
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>there. She was there; and in the heart of the evening,
when Blount had persuaded her to sit out a
dance with him in a corner of the homelike reception-hall,
he began to pry at a little stone of
stumbling which was threatening to grow too large
to be easily rolled aside.</p>

<p>"I'm hunting a conscience to-night," he said,
without preface. "Have you got one that you
could lend me?"</p>

<p>She laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"You told me once that I had the New England
conscience&#8212;which was the same as saying that I
had enough for my own needs and a surplus to pass
around among my friends. What bad thing have
you been doing now?"</p>

<p>He made a wry face. "It's the 'practical politics'
again. Suppose I say that I have obtained
positive evidence of a crime against the laws of the
State and the nation. How far am I justified in
suppressing, for a perfectly right and proper end,
this evidence which would send a lot of people to
jail?"</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she exclaimed; "how you can bring a
thunderbolt crashing down out of a perfectly clear
sky! Is it ever justifiable to shield criminals and
criminality?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>"That is just what I'm trying to find out," he
persisted. "At the present moment I am shielding
a good handful of open lawbreakers. Some of them
know what I'm doing, and some of them don't.
Those who know have been told that they must be
good or I'll publish the evidence, and they've promised
to be good if I won't publish it. At the time
I didn't question my right to make such a bargain,
but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"But now you are questioning it? What would
happen if you should tell what you know?"</p>

<p>"Chaos," he replied briefly.</p>

<p>"May I ask who is implicated?"</p>

<p>"A good half of the corporation officials in the
State, and some few outside of it."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she said again. And then: "It's too
big for me, Evan. I can only go back to first principles
and ask if it is ever justifiable to do evil that
good may come."</p>

<p>"If you put it that way, I've made myself <i>particeps
criminis</i>," he said gravely. "I have given my
word to keep still if the lawbreaking deals are broken
off at once and in good faith. Beyond that, I can't
help knowing that the exposure which I have threatened
to make, and could make, would practically
turn the people of this State into a mob."</p>

<p>She was shaking her head determinedly. "I can't
help you this time, Evan; truly I can't." Then,
in sudden appeal: "Why won't you go to your
father? He could tell you what to do and how to
do it, and his judgment would be too big and just
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>to stumble over the tangling little moralities."</p>

<p>Blount smiled.</p>

<p>"What if I should tell you that my father is more
or less involved, Patricia? I don't know precisely
how much or how little, but I am assured, by those
who claim to know, that he, too, would go down in
the general wreck."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" she protested, in generous
loyalty. "These people, whoever they are, are deceiving
you to shelter themselves. Have you ever
spoken to your father about this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once; one evening when we were dining
together I told him what I had, and what use I
should make of it if all other means should fail.
Also, I advised him to dodge."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"That is the discouraging part of it. I was hoping
against hope that he would tell me to go ahead;
that he would say that he wasn't involved. But,
as a matter of fact, he didn't say much of anything.
I'm horribly afraid that his silence meant all that
I've been trying to believe it didn't mean."</p>

<p>She was slowly opening and closing her fan, as if
she were trying to gain time.</p>
<p><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></p>
<p>"I can only tell you again what I told you at
first," she said at length. "You must be bigger
than all these hampering circumstances; bigger than
the little moralities, if need be. You can be, Evan;
you've given splendid proof of it thus far, and I'm
proud&#8212;just as proud as I can be&#8212;"</p>

<p>Blount felt as if he could, joyously and entirely
without scruple, have brained young Gordon, to
whom the next dance belonged, and who came just at
this climaxing moment to claim Patricia. But there
was no help for it, short of a cold-blooded and rather
embarrassing deed of violence, and the hard-won
confidence ended pretty much where it had begun.</p>

<p>When he left the Gordon house, which was far
out in the northeastern residence suburb, Blount
meant to go directly to the hotel and to bed. He
had been losing much sleep in the activities of the
campaign, and the loss was beginning to tell upon
him. But as the trolley-car was passing the Temple
Court Building he made sure that he saw a dim
light illuminating the windows of his upper-floor office.
With all his suspicions of the morning reawakened,
he dropped from the car, dashed into the
building, and took the all-night elevator for his office
floor.</p>

<p>The sleepy elevator-man had to be shaken awake,
and when he had set the car in motion he let it run
past the designated floor. Blount swore impatiently,
and instead of waiting to be carried back, darted
out and ran to the <a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>stairway. When he reached the
lower corridor and was hurrying toward his suite in
the corner of the building, there was a dull crash, as
of a muffled explosion, and two or three of the glass
doors in the street-fronting suite were shattered.
Blount quickened his pace to a run, let himself in
by means of his latch-key, and, cautiously opening
his desk, groped in an inner drawer for the revolver
which Gantry had persuaded him to buy as
a part of the office furnishings.</p>

<p>With the weapon in hand, he pushed through the
unlatched door into Collins's room. There was an
acrid odor of dynamite fumes in the air, and when
he pressed on to the third room of the suite the gases
were stifling. His first act was to feel for the
switch and cut in the electric lights. The third room,
which had doors of communication with his own
office and Collins's, was a wreck. Desks were
broken open, and the safe-door had been blown from
its hinges.</p>

<p>Blount saw the figure of a small man with his cap
pulled down over his ears bending over the wrecked
cash-box. At the upblazing of the ceiling lights,
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>the man sprang to his feet and fled, going out through
the door by which Blount had just entered, and snapping
the light-switch as he passed to leave the rooms
in darkness.</p>

<p>Blount was cursing his own lack of presence of
mind when he turned to follow the escaping burglar.
In the darkness he fell over a chair, and by the time
he had disentangled himself and had reached the
corridor the safe-blower was gone. Racing to the
elevator, Blount rang the bell until the sleepy car-tender
set the machinery in motion and lifted himself
to the floor of happenings. Here the incident
ended abruptly, so far as any helpful discoveries
were concerned. The elevator-man had carried no
one down, and he confessed shamefacedly that he
had again been asleep, and could not say whether
or not anybody had descended the stair which circled
the elevator-shaft.</p>

<p>Blount went back to his office, turned in a police
alarm, and waited until a policeman came from the
nearest station. Then he went to report the safe-blowing
in person to the night captain on duty in<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>
the basement of the City Hall. A drowsy clerk took
notes of the story, and the night captain contented
himself with asking a single question.</p>

<p>"Do you know how much you lost, Mr. Blount?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of any great consequence, I imagine,"
said Blount, remembering, with an inward thrill
of thankfulness, the morning impulse which had
prompted him to transfer the one thing of inestimable
consequence to the security of the bank safe-deposit
box. Then he added: "There was a little
money in the box, and some papers of no especial
value to anybody. Just the same, captain, I want
that man caught."</p>

<p>"We'll catch him, come morning," was the assurance,
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>and then Blount went away and carried
out his original intention of going to the Inter-Mountain
and to bed.</p>

<p>To bed; but, for a long hour after the post-midnight
quiet had settled down upon the great hostelry, not
to sleep. If he had asked himself why he could not
close his eyes and take the needed rest, the exciting
incident in which he had lately been an actor would
have offered a sufficient answer. But in reality the
sharpened spur of wakefulness penetrated much more
deeply. Beyond all doubt or shadow of doubt, it
was the sinister, many-armed machine which had
reached out to seize and destroy the evidence against
its allies and fellow conspirators, the lawbreaking
railroad company and the vote-selling corporations.</p>

<p>And, again beyond doubt, he made sure, it was his
own boast made to his father which had been passed
on to tell the sham burglar where to look and what
to look for.</p>

<h3>ON THE KNEES OF THE HIGH GODS</h3>


<p>In the evening of the day following the safe-blowing
in Blount's office, a one-car train, running as
second section of the Overland, slipped unostentatiously
into the capital railroad yard. With as little
stir as it had made in its arrival, the single-car train
took a siding below the freight station, where it would
be concealed from the prying eyes of any chance
prowler from the newspaper offices.</p>

<p>Coincident with the side-tracking O'Brien, the
vice-president's stenographer, dropped from the
step of the car and went in search of a telephone.
When O'Brien was safely out of the way, a small
man, clean-shaven and alert in his movements,
whipped out of the shadows of the nearest string of
box-cars, pushed brusquely past the guarding porter,
and presented himself at the desk in the roomy office
compartment of the private car.</p>

<p>The vice-president looked up and nodded. "How
are you, Gibbert?" he said, and the<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>n: "You may condense
your report. I have seen the newspapers.
In passing I may say that it isn't much to your
credit that you had to fall back upon the methods
of the yeggmen."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any other way," protested the
small man. "The papers were locked up in the
cash-box of the safe, and young Blount carried the
only key."</p>

<p>"It was crude; not at all worthy of a man of
your ability, Gibbert. And if the newspapers tell
it straight, you came near being caught. How did
that happen?"</p>

<p>"Blount went to a ball, and I shadowed him.
His girl was there, and it looked like a safe bet
that he'd stay to see the lights put out. But he
didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind; you got the papers, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The company detective drew a thick envelope
from his pocket and laid it upon the desk. The
vice-president tore it open and read rapidly through
the file of letters it had enclosed, tearing them one
by one fr<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>om the hold of the brass fastener at the
upper left-hand corner as he glanced them over.
"The chuckle-headed fools!" he gritted, apostrophizing
the writers of the letters. And then: "Gibbert,
I'd like to go into this a little deeper, if we had
time; I'd like to know why in hell every man in
this State with whom we've had a private business
arrangement found it necessary to spread the details
out on paper and send them to young Blount! Here;
burn these things as I hand them to you."</p>

<p>The small man struck a match and, using the
wide-mouthed metal cuspidor for an ash-pan, lighted
the letters one at a time as they were given to him.
When the cinder skeleton of the final sheet had been
crushed into ashes, he rose from his knees and
reached for his hat.</p>

<p>"Any other orders?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; nothing more. You are reasonably sure
that you haven't been recognized here by any of
our local people?"</p>

<p>"I've kept the 'make-up' on most of the time.
I've been in Mr. Gantry's office a couple of times,
and in Mr. Kittredge's once, and neither of them
caught on to me."</p><p><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a></p>

<p>"That's good. You'd better go now. O'Brien
has gone after Gantry and Kittredge, and I don't
care to have them find you here. Better take the
first train back to Chicago. These mutton-headed
police here might possibly get on your track, and
we don't want to have to explain anything to
them."</p>

<p>Five minutes after the small man had dropped
from the step of the "008," to disappear in the box-car
shadows, Gantry and Kittredge came down the
yard and entered the private car. Again the vice-president
said, "How are you?" and nodded toward
the nearest chairs. "Sit down; I'll be through in a
minute," and he went on reading the file of papers
taken up at the departure of the detective. At the
end of the minute he shot a question at the two
who were waiting.</p>

<p>"You got my message?"</p>

<p>Gantry answered for himself and the superintendent.
"Yes. Your orders have been carried out.
The yards are posted, and nobody, outside of a few
of our own men, knows that yo<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>ur car is here."</p>

<p>The vice-president took one of the long black
cigars from the open box on the flat-topped desk,
and passed the box to his two lieutenants.</p>

<p>"Light up," he said tersely. "I'm due in Twin
Canyons City to-morrow morning, and we've got
to thresh this thing out in a hurry. Any change
in the situation since your last report?"</p>

<p>Gantry shook his head. "Nothing very important.
Blount's up-town office was broken into last
night and his safe ripped open with dynamite, as I
suppose you have read in the papers. Who did it,
or why it was done, nobody seems to know."</p>

<p>"Well, what came of it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, so far as I can find out," returned the
traffic manager. "Blount had been to the Gordon
dance, and he saw the light in his office as he was
coming down-town. When he went up to find out
what was going on, he caught the safe-blower fairly
in the act, but the fellow got away."</p>

<p>"Did Blount lose anything?"</p>

<p>"That's the queer part of it. Blount won't say
much about it; and this morning he went around
to police headquarters and told the chief to drop
the matter, giving as his reason that he was too busy
to prosecute the fellow even if he was caught."</p>

<p>To a disinterested observer it might have seemed
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>a little singular that the vice-president made no further
comment upon the burglary. As a matter of
fact, his next question completely ignored it.</p>

<p>"What has Blount been doing this week?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"He has spoken twice; once at Arequipa and once
at Hellersville. I understand he has engagements
enough to keep him out of town right up to election
day."</p>

<p>"That is good," was the nodded approval. "He
would only be in the way here at the capital." And
then pointedly to Gantry: "Any more of that nonsense
about putting a barrel of powder under us
and blowing us all up if we don't build the freight
tariffs over to suit his notion?"</p>

<p>"A good bit more of it," Gantry admitted reluctantly.
"The other day he went so far as to set a
time limit; gave me three days of grace in which to
file the public notice of the change in rates."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I filed the notice&#8212;taking care that the only
copy should be the one I sent to Blount's office."</p>

<p><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>The vice-president looked coldly at his division
traffic manager.</p>

<p>"There are times, Gantry, when you seem to be
losing your grip. Dave Blount's son isn't a school-boy,
to be fooled by such a transparent trick as that!
Don't you suppose he knows, as well as you do, that
the public notice has to be filed in every station on
the road?"</p>

<p>"I had to take a chance&#8212;I've had to take a good
many chances," protested the traffic manager in his
own defence; and Kittredge, a bearded giant who
was fully the vice-president's match in heroic physique,
removed his cigar to say: "That young fellow
has been a frost. If he isn't a wild-eyed fanatic,
as Gantry insists he is, he is deeper than the
deep blue sea! I'd just about as soon have a box
of dynamite kicking around underfoot as to have
him messing in this campaign fight. I've been keeping
cases on him, as you ordered, and he has worn
out three of my best office men on the job."</p>

<p>"You are prejudiced, Kittredge," was the vice-preside<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>nt's
comment. "It was the best move in
the entire campaign&#8212;putting him in the field.
Apart from the public sentiment he has been turning
our way, we mustn't lose sight of the fact that
we got hold of him at a time when the Honorable
Senator was getting ready to turn us down."</p>

<p>"Speaking of the sentiment," Gantry put in, "I
don't know whether it's all sentiment or not. There's
a sort of mystery mixed up in this speech-making
business of Blount's. At first I thought maybe his
sudden popularity was due to some word sent out
from your Chicago office; but when you told me it
wasn't, I began to do a little speculating on my own
account. I can't make up my mind yet whether it
is pure popularity, or whether it's the assisted kind."</p>

<p>"Assisted?" said the vice-president, with a lifting
of the heavy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes. It has been too unanimous. I have a
trustworthy man in Blount's up-town office, and he
says the invitations have fluttered in like autumn
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>leaves; more than Blount could accept if he travelled
continuously. Kittredge's men report that the
speech-making has been a triumphant progress all
over the State; bands, receptions, committees, and
banquets wherever Blount goes."</p>

<p>Mr. McVickar grunted. "The speeches have been
all that anybody could ask. I've been reading
them."</p>

<p>Kittredge shook his head.</p>

<p>"Gantry says they are, but I say no," he contended.
"There is such a thing as putting too much
sugar in the coffee. Blount's overdoing it; he's
putting the whitewash on so thick that any little
handful of mud that happens to be thrown will stick
and look bad."</p>

<p>"Of course, we have to take chances on that,"
was the vice-president's qualifying clause. "Nevertheless,
young Blount's talk has undoubtedly had<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>
its effect upon public sentiment. We must be careful
not to let the opposition newspapers get hold of
anything that would tend to nullify it."</p>

<p>"They are moving heaven and earth to do it,"
said the superintendent. "The Honorable David
is lying low, as he usually does, but I more than
half believe he's getting ready to give us the double-cross.
That is the explanation of this safe-blowing
scrape, as I put it up."</p>

<p>Again the vice-president failed to comment further
on the burglary. "What I am most afraid of,
now, is that our young man may be, as you say,
Kittredge, a trifle over-zealous," he said musingly.
"We have discovered that he is something of a
fanatic."</p>

<p>"He's more than that," Kittredge cut in quickly.
"One of the men I've had following him&#8212;Farnsworth&#8212;is
as good as any Pinkerton that ever walked.
He says Blount isn't half so innocent as he looks
and acts. The speech-making has taken him into
every corner of t<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>he State, and Farnsworth says he
has been doing a lot of quiet prying around and
investigating on the side."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," Gantry added, "what a
beautiful mix-up we should have if the senator and
his son should both conclude to pull out and get
together at the last moment."</p>

<p>The master plotter shook his head. "You have
no sense of perspective, Gantry. Young Blount is
with us solely because he is too straightforward to
countenance his father's political methods. On the
other hand, if the Honorable Dave should turn upon
us now, he would be obliged to do it at the expense
of his son's reputation. Anything he could say
against us would simply have the effect of holding
his son up to public exprobration as a common
campaign liar. I know David Blount pretty well;
he won't do anything like that."</p>

<p>Gantry bit his lip and a slow smile of respectful
admiration crept up to the Irish eyes.</p>

<p>"When it comes to the real fine-haire<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>d work, you
have us all feeling for hand-holds, Mr. McVickar,"
he said. "Now I know why you made a place for
Evan Blount, and why you have been giving him a
free hand on the whitewashing. It's the biggest thing
that has ever been pulled off in Western politics!"</p>

<p>"It hasn't been pulled off yet," was the quick
reply. "We are holding old David in a noose that
may turn into a rope of sand at any minute; don't
forget that. During the few days intervening before
the election we must preserve the present status
at any cost. Young Blount is the only man who
may possibly disturb it. Keep him out of the way.
If he doesn't have speaking invitations enough to
busy him, see to it that he gets them. As long
as you can keep him talking he won't have any time
for side issues. Now about this Gryson business:
you want to handle that yourselves, and I don't
want any more telegrams like the one you sent me
last night, Gantry. What's the condition?"</p>

<p>Gantry outlined the Gryson "condition" briefly.
The man Gryson, who had developed into a heeler
of sorts, had been growing restive, wanting more
money.</p>

<p>"What can he swing?" was the curt question.</p>

<p>"Six out of seven pretty close counties. I don't
pretend to know how he has done it, but he has got
the goods; I've taken the trouble to check up on
him. With his pull, we can swing the vote of the capital
itself."</p>

<p>The vice-president frowned thoughtfully. "The<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>
old game of stuffing the registration lists, I suppose,"
he said. And then:"Young Blount hasn't got wind
of this, has he?"</p>

<p>Gantry laughed. "You may be sure he hasn't.
He has it in for Gryson on general principles&#8212;made
us take him off the shop pay-rolls. If he thought
we were dickering with him now, he'd be down on
us like a thousand of brick."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you fix Gryson, once for all,
and have it over with? You oughtn't to expect me
to come here and tell you what to do!"</p>

<p>It was at this point that Kittredge broke in.</p>

<p>"Gryson isn't safe. I have it straight that he is
getting ready to sell us out. That's why he wants
his pay in advance."</p>

<p>The vice-president's heavy brows met in a frown,
and the muscles of his square jaw hardened.</p>

<p>"Put Gryson on the rack and show him what
you've got on him in that Montana bank robbery.
That will bring him to book. It will be time enough
to talk abo<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>ut terms when he delivers the goods.
Now another thing&#8212;that Shonoho Inn matter that
I wired about&#8212;what has been done?"</p>

<p>"It is all arranged," said the big superintendent.
"The house was closed for the season last month,
and we have taken a short lease. One of our dining-car
managers will take charge of the service."</p>

<p>"And the wires?"</p>

<p>"We have made a cut-in from the old Shoshone
Mine wire, which wasn't taken down when the mine
was abandoned. That let us out very neatly, and
no one outside of our own line-men know anything
about the job. We have four instruments in the
hotel writing-room; two on the commercial and two
on the railroad wires. Will that be enough?"</p>

<p>Mr. McVickar nodded and reached over to press
the bell-push which signalled to his train conductor.</p>

<p>"That is about all I have to say," he said, in dismissal
of the two local officials. "Just nail Gryson
up to the cross, where he belongs, and keep young<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>
Blount busy and out of town; I leave the details
to you. Get orders for me as you go up to your
office, Kittredge, and have the despatcher let me
out as soon as possible. I ought to be half-way to
Alkali by this time."</p>

<h3>THE CHASM</h3>


<p>It was young Ranlett, a reporter for <i>The Plainsman</i>,
who told Evan Blount of the arrival of the
vice-president's car, running as second section of the
Overland, and the scene of the telling was the lobby
of the Inter-Mountain Hotel, where Blount was
smoking a pipe of disappointment filled and lighted
upon hearing that his father, Mrs. Honoria, and
Patricia had gone out to dinner somewhere&#8212;place
unknown to the obliging room clerk.</p>

<p>Ranlett had tried ineffectually to get to the private
car, having for his object the interviewing of
the vice-president, but there had been curious obstructions.
The lower yard was apparently carefully
guarded, since the reporter had been turned
back at three or four different points when he had
attempted to cross the tracks. Blount thought it
a little singular that the vice-president should come
to the capital secretly, but he did not s<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>top to speculate
upon this.</p>

<p>Having something more than a suspicion that
Gantry had not properly passed the threat of exposure
up to McVickar, he determined at once to
seek an interview with the vice-president. Walking
rapidly down to the Sierra Avenue station, he saw
a light in Gantry's office, and meaning to be fair
first and severe afterward, if needful, he ran up the
stair and tried the door of the traffic manager's office.
It opened under his hand, and he found Gantry sitting
at his desk.</p>

<p>"Ranlett tells me that Mr. McVickar is in town,"
he began abruptly. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Ranlett is mistaken&#8212;about twenty minutes mistaken,"
was Gantry's reply. "Mr. McVickar passed
through here a few minutes ago on his way to Twin
Canyons City. His special has been gone some little
time."</p>

<p>"When is he coming back?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"I <a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>did."</p>

<p>"Did you take up with him the matter of issuing
new tariffs to do away with the preferentials, or to
level the public rates down to them?"</p>

<p>Gantry shifted uneasily in his chair, and tried to
evade. "There was very little time," he said. "Mr.
McVickar was in a great hurry, and his special was
held only a few minutes."</p>

<p>Blount crossed the room and sat down.</p>

<p>"Dick, we've come to the last round-up," he said
gravely. "In the nature of things, I can't give you
any more time. You've been playing with me all
along, and your last move in the game was a very
childish one&#8212;sending me what purported to be a
copy of a new freight tariff notice to the public.
Did you suppose for a moment that I wouldn't have
sense enough to see that the thing wasn't official,
that it had no signatures and lacked even the name
of the railroad company? I'm here now to tell you
that you've got to do some real thing, and do it
quickly. Let's go up and see the editor of <i>The
Capital</i>."</p>

<p><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>"What for?" demanded Gantry.</p>

<p>"It is the railroad paper, and I want you to give
Brinkley, the editor, an interview to the effect that
a revision of the freight rates is in process, and that
shippers having grievances should present them at
once. That will at least start the ball to rolling in
the right direction."</p>

<p>"I should think it would!" scoffed the traffic manager.
"What you don't know about the making of
freight tariffs would sink a ship, Evan. These things
can't be done while you wait!"</p>

<p>"But they must be, in this instance," Blount
insisted. "If you won't withdraw the preferentials
given to the corporations, you must do the other
thing. Post your legal notice of a reduction of the
rates on the commodities upon which you are now
allowing rebates, and I'll fight straight through on
the line I've been taking all along."</p>

<p>"And if we don't?" queried Gantry.</p>

<p>"What is the use of making me say it for the
hundredth time, Dick? If you don't do one or the
other, there will be an explosion, just as I've told
you. Of course, you know that my safe was broken
open last night&#8212;wrecked with dynamite?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, unluckily for you, the packet of papers
which might otherwise have been taken or destroyed,
didn't happen to be in the safe. The documents are
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>still where they can be used at an hour's notice.
And, by heaven, Dick, I'll use them if you don't
play fair!"</p>

<p>Gantry, long-suffering and patient to a fault in a
business affair, was not altogether superhuman.</p>

<p>"Evan, you are a frost&#8212;a black frost! You harp
on one string until you wear it to frazzles! Don't
you know that the Transcontinental is big enough
and strong enough to chivvy you from one end of
this country to the other, if you turn traitor? I
love a fighting man, but by God, I haven't any use
for a fool!"</p>

<p>Blount laughed.</p>

<p>"If I have succeeded in making you angry, perhaps
there is a chance that you will do something.
You may curse me out all you want to, but the
fact remains. I'm going to explode the bomb, and
it will be touched off long enough before election to
do the work, if you keep on refusing to make my
word good to the people. That is all&#8212;<i>all</i> the all.
Now, will you go up to <i>The Capital</i> office with me,
and dictate that bit of information that I mentioned?"</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years!" raged Gantry. "Not
in ten thousand years!" Nevertheless he rose, closed
his desk, and prepared to accompany the importunate
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>political manager. Half-way up the first square
he said: "There is no use in our going to <i>The Capital</i>
office at this time of night. Brinkley doesn't get
around to his desk much before eleven. Let's go
up to the club."</p>

<p>At the Railway Club the traffic manager developed
a keen desire to kill the intervening time in a game
of billiards. Blount indulged him, beat him three
games in succession, and consistently refused to
drink with him. At the end of the third game,
Gantry gave a terse definition, abusively worded,
of a man who would force his friend to go and drink
alone, and went to the buffet. Ten minutes later,
when Blount went after him, he had disappeared,
and the visit to the newspaper office was postponed,
perforce.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Blount found a telegram
on his desk. It bore the vice-president's name,
and the date-line was Twin Canyons City. It directed
him to go to a remote portion of the State
beyond the Lost River Mountains to examine the
papers in a right-of-way case which was coming up
for trial at the next term of court. This was in Kittredge's
department, and Blount called the superintendent
on the phone. Kittredge was in hi<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>s office,
and he evidently knew about the vice-president's
telegram. Also, he seemed anxious to have the division
counsel go to Lewiston at once; so anxious that
he offered his own service-car to be run as a special
train.</p>

<p>Blount saw no way to evade a positive order from
the vice-president, but he was more than suspicious
that Gantry or Kittredge, or possibly both of them,
had misrepresented the right-of-way case to Mr.
McVickar, in an attempt to get him away from the
city and so to postpone a reiteration of the demand
for a new freight tariff. What he did not suspect
was that Mr. McVickar's telegram might possibly
have originated in Kittredge's office.</p>

<p>Asking the superintendent to have the service-car
made ready immediately, he packed his handbag,
left a note for Patricia, who was not yet visible,
and another for Gantry, who was not in his office,
and began the roundabout journey.</p>

<p>In all his travelling up and down the State he
had never found anything to equal the slowness of
the special train. The noon meal, served by Kittredge's
cook in the open compartment, found the
special less than fifty miles on its way, and comfortably
waiting at that hour on a side-track among
the sage-brush hills for the coming of a delayed train
in the opposite direction. Four mortal hours were
lost on<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a> the lonely siding. There was no station, and
Blount could not telegraph. So far as he knew, the
service-car might stay there for a day or a week.
It was all to no purpose that he quarrelled with his
conductor. The train crew had orders to wait for
the west-bound time freight, and there was nothing
to do but to keep on waiting.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the time freight, or some
other train, came along, and the special was once
more set in motion eastward, but at dinner-time it
was again side-tracked, eighty-odd miles from its
destination, and once more at a desert siding where
there was no telegraph office. The car was still
standing on the siding when Blount went to bed.
But in the morning it was in motion again, jogging
now on its leisurely way up the branch line.</p>

<p>At Lewiston, the town at the end of the branch
where the right-of-way trouble had originated, Blount
found more delay, carefully planned for, as he had
now come firmly to believe. The plaintiffs in the
right-of-way case were out of town, and their lawyers
had gone to the capital. Blount saw that he
might wait a week without accomplishing anything,
hence he immediately instructed his conductor to
get orders for the return.</p>

<p>After having been gone a half-hour or more, the
conductor came back to the service-car to say that
the single telegraph-wire connecting Lewiston with
the outer world was down, and that the orders for
the return journey could not be obtained until the
telegraph connection was restored. At that point
Blount took matters into his own hands.</p>

<p>There was a mining company having its headquarters<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>
in the isolated town, and Blount had met
the manager once in the capital&#8212;met him in a social
way, and had been able to show him some little
attention. Hiring a buckboard at the one livery
stable in the place, he drove out to the "Little
Mary," and found Blatchford, the friendly manager,
smoking a black clay cutty pipe in his shack office.
It did not take Blount over a minute to renew the
pleasant acquaintance, and to state his dilemma.</p>

<p>"I'm hung up here with my special train, the wires
are down and I can't get out," was his statement of
the crude fact. "Didn't you tell me that you owned
a motor-car?"</p>

<p>"I did," was the prompt reply. "Want to borrow
it?"</p>

<p>"You beat me to it," said Blount, laughing.
"That was precisely what I was going to beg for&#8212;the
loan of your car. I believe you told me that
you had driven it from here to the capital."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; several times, and the road is fairly
good by way of Arequipa and Lost River Canyon.
It's only about half as far across country as it is
around by the railroad. You ought to make it in
six hours and a half, or seven at the longest. Drive
me down to the burg, and I'll put you in possession."</p>

<p><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>Blount began to be audibly thankful, but the mine
manager good-naturedly cut him short.</p>

<p>"It's all in the day's work, Mr. Blount, and I'm
glad to be of service&#8212;not because you are the
Transcontinental's lawyer, nor altogether because
you are the Honorable David's son. I haven't forgotten
your kindness to me when I was in town
three weeks ago. Let's go and get out the chug-wagon."</p>

<p>A little later Blount found himself handling the
wheel of a very serviceable knockabout car equipped
for hard work on country roads. When he was ready
to go, he drove down to the railroad yard and hunted
up his conductor.</p>

<p>"After you have had your vacation, you may get
orders from Mr. Kittredge and take his car back to
the capital," he told the man. "When you do, you
may give him my compliments, and tell him I preferred
to run my own special train."</p>

<p>The conductor grinned and made no reply, and
he was still grinning when he sauntered into the
railroad telegraph office and spoke to the operator.</p>

<p>"I dunno what's up," he said, "but whatever it
was, the string's broke. Old Dave Sage-Brush's
son has borrowed him an automobile, and gone back
to town on his own hook. Guess you'd better call
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>up the division despatcher and tell him the broken-wire
gag didn't work. Get a move on. We hain't
got nothin' to stay here for now."</p>

<p>Blount had a very pleasant drive across country,
with no mishap worse than a blown-out tire and a
little carbureter trouble. Being a motorist of parts,
neither the accident nor the needed readjustment
detained him very long, and by the middle of the
afternoon he was racing down the smooth northern
road, with the spires and tall buildings of the capital
fairly in sight.</p>

<p>Not to let gratitude lag too far behind the service
rendered, he drove Blatchford's car to the garage
nearest the freight station, left instructions to have
it shipped back to Lewiston by the first train, and
promptly went in search of Gantry. The traffic
manager was not in his office, but Blount found him
at the Railway Club.</p>

<p>"Just a word, Dick," he began, when he had overtaken
his man pointing for the buffet. "Kittredge
put up a job on me, and I think you helped him.<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>
I had to borrow an automobile to come back in
from Lewiston. It's down at the Central Garage,
and I have given Bankston, the garage man, orders
to ship it back to Mr. Blatchford, of the 'Little
Mary.' I wish you'd phone your freight agent to
see that it is properly taken care of, and that the
freight bill is sent to me."</p>

<p>Gantry made no reply, but he went obediently to
the house telephone and gave the necessary instructions.
The thing done, he turned shortly upon
Blount, scowling morosely.</p>

<p>"Come on in and let's have a drink," he said.</p>

<p>Blount marked the brittleness of tone and the
half-quarrelsome light in the eyes which were a little
bloodshot.</p>

<p>"No, Dick; you've had one too many already,"
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>he objected firmly.</p>

<p>Gantry put his back against the wall of the corridor.</p>

<p>"No," he rasped; "I'm not drunk, but I'm ready
to fight you to a finish, and for once in a way I'm
going to get in the first lick. You've been bluffing
me from the start, and you're going to try it again.
It won't go this time; you've got to show me!"</p>

<p>If Blount hesitated it was only because he was
trying to determine whether or not the traffic manager
was business-fit. Gantry comprehended perfectly,
and his laugh was derisive and a trifle bitter.</p>

<p>"You're sizing me up and asking yourself if I'm
too far gone to be worth while," he jeered. "If I
couldn't stand any more liquid grief than you can,
I would have been down and out years ago. Show
your hand, Evan&#8212;if you have any to show."</p>

<p>Blount hesitated no longer. Taking Gantry's arm,
he led him out of the club and around the block to<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>
the Sierra National Bank. It was after banking
hours, but the side door giving access to the safe-deposit
department was still open. With the traffic
manager at his elbow, Blount asked the custodian
for his private box, got it, and led the way to one
of the cell-like retiring rooms. Gantry proved his
capacity for transacting business by turning on the
lights, locking the door, and squaring himself in a
chair at one side of the tiny writing-table.</p>

<p>Blount opened the japanned safety box, took out
a bulky envelope and tossed it across to the traffic
manager.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself whether I've been
bluffing or not," he said quietly; and then he turned
his back and interested himself in the lithograph of
the latest Atlantic liner framed and hanging upon
the mahogany end wall of the small room.</p>

<p>For a little time there was a dead silence, broken
only by the faint rustling of the papers as Gantry
withdrew and unfolded them. When he had glanced
at the last folded letter sheet, he snapped the rubber
band upon the sheaf and sat back in his chair.
Blount turned at the snap and found the traffic
manager smiling curiously up at him.</p>
<p><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></p>
<p>"Sit down, Evan," was the friendly invitation.
And when Blount had dropped into the opposite
chair: "We used to be pretty good friends in the
old days, Ebee," Gantry went on, falling easily into
the use of the college nickname. "I haven't forgotten
the time when I would have had to break
and go home if you hadn't stood by me like a brother
and lent me money. For that reason, and for some
others, I hate to see you bucking a dead wall out
here in the greasewood hills."</p>

<p>"It is you and your kind who are bucking the
dead wall, Dick."</p>

<p>"No, listen; I'm giving it to you straight, now.
A few minutes ago you thought I was drunk&#8212;possibly
too far gone to serve your purpose. I wasn't;
I was merely sick and disgusted at the spectacle
afforded by a crafty, crooked, double-dealing old
world&#8212;the world we're living in. Once in a blue
moon an honest man turns up, and when that happens
he's got to be broken on the wheel&#8212;as you're
going to be broken. Oh, yes; I came out with
ideals, too, but they've been knocked out of me.
We all have to keep the lock-step in business, and
business is hell, Evan. I'm honest to my salt&#8212;which
is to say that as yet I'm not using my job to
line my own pockets, but that's the one decent thing
that can be said of me. Don't let me bore you."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Blount soberly. "I don't see the
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>pointing of it yet, but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"You will when I tell you that I've been lying
to you; faking first one thing and then another.
Do you get that?"</p>

<p>"I hear you say it; yes."</p>

<p>"It's so. I faked that story about your father's
having made an underground deal with us. It was
a lie out of whole cloth, because I didn't believe at
that time that he had. There had been a falling
out between him and Mr. McVickar; that was common
talk on the division. But until yesterday I
didn't know for certain that the trouble had been
patched up; in fact, I had my own reasons for believing
that it hadn't been patched up."</p>

<p>"And you told me there was an alliance in order
that I might believe that my father would be involved
in an exposure of the railroad's double-dealing
with the public?"</p>

<p>"Just that. Self-preservation is the primal law&#8212;after
you've dropped the ideals&#8212;and I thought
I had invented a way to hold you down. I might
have saved myself the trouble&#8212;and the lie. It
comes down to this, Evan: you are one man against
a crooked world, and you haven't had a ghost of a
show from the first minute."</p><p><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></p>

<p>"You'll have to make it plainer," was the even-toned
rejoinder. "As matters stand now, I am
pretty well assured that I can do what I set out to
do. I'm going to be able to make my own employers
come through with clean hands."</p>

<p>Gantry was shaking his head slowly, and again
the curious smile flitted across his keen, fine-featured
face, lingering for an instant at the corners of
the eyes.</p>

<p>"You say I'll have to make it plainer, and I will.
A little while ago you intimated that Kittredge and
I were responsible for the telegram which sent you
to Lewiston yesterday. It was a fake, but it didn't
originate with Kittredge or with me."</p>

<p>"With whom, then?"</p>

<p>"I hate to tell you, Evan&#8212;it'll hit you hard.
The frame-up was your father's. He got hold of
Kittredge the night before, some time after we had
left my office together to go up-town. He told Kittredge
it was for the good of 'the cause,' and suggested
that a wire purporting to come from Mr.
McVickar would probably turn the trick. He didn't
give his reason for wanting to get you out of the
way at this time, and Kittredge didn't ask it."</p>

<p>Blount was pinning the traffic manager down with
an eyehold which was like a gripping hand, and the
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>close air of the little mahogany bank cell became
suddenly charged with the subtle effluence of antagonism.
Blount was the first to break the painful
silence.</p>

<p>"You have told me nothing new, Dick, or at least
nothing that I have not been taking for granted almost
from the beginning. But let it be understood
between us, once for all, that I discuss my father,
his motives, or his acts, with no man living. We'll
drop that phase of it; it's a side issue, and has no
bearing upon the business that brought us here.
You asked for the proof of my ability to compel
your employers and mine to turn over the clean
leaf. You have it there under your hand."</p>

<p>For answer, Gantry pushed the rubber-banded file
across the table to his companion. "Take another
look, Evan, and see how helpless you are in the grip
of a crooked world," he said, very gently.</p>

<p>Blount caught up the file and ran it through. It
was made up wholly of pieces of blank paper, cut to
letter-size, and clipped at the corner with a brass
fastener, as the originals had been.</p>

<p><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a></p>

<h3>A COG IN THE WHEEL</h3>


<p>While Blount was staring abstractedly at the
file of blank sheets which had been substituted for
the incriminating letters of the vote-selling corporation
managers, with Gantry sitting back, alert and
watchful, to mark the first signs of the coming storm,
there came a tap on the locked door of the little
room, and a deprecatory voice said: "It's our closing
time, gentlemen: if you are about through&#8212;"</p>

<p>"In a minute," returned Gantry quickly, and then
he took the blank dummy out of Blount's hands,
pocketed it, shut the japanned safety box, and
touched his companion's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this, Evan," he said, still speaking
as one speaks to a hurt child. "Conroy wants
to close up."</p>

<p>Blount suffered himself to be led away, and in
the vault room he went mechanically through the
motions of locking up the empty box. In the street
Gantry once more took the lead, walking his silent
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>charge around the block and into the Temple Court
elevator. A little later, when the door of the private
room in the up-town legal office had opened to
admit them, and Blount had dropped heavily into his
own desk chair, Gantry plunged promptly into the
breach.</p>

<p>"We've been friendly enemies in this thing right
from the start, Evan," he began, "and that's as it
had to be. But blood&#8212;even the blood of a college
brotherhood&#8212;is thicker than water. I know now
what you're in for, and I'm going to stand by you,
if it costs me my job. First, let's clear the way a
bit. If I say that I haven't had anything to do,
even by implication, with this jolt you've just been
given, will you believe me?"</p>

<p>Blount lifted a pair of heavy-lidded eyes and let
them rest for an instant upon the face of the traffic
manager. "If you say so, Dick, I'll believe it," he
returned.</p>

<p>"Good. Now we can dive into the thick of it.
I won't insult you by doubting the premising fact.
You had the evidence once?"</p>

<p>"I did&#8212;enough of it to keep a grand jury busy
<a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>for a month. It came to me in the shape of unsolicited
letters from the men who are benefiting by the
railroad company's evasion of the law, and who are,
of course, equally criminal with the railroad officials.
Why these letters were written to me I don't know,
Gantry. I merely know that they were wholly unsolicited."</p>

<p>"They were written to you because you are supposed
to be the doctor in the present crisis."</p>

<p>"But good God, Dick! Haven't I been shouting
from every platform in the State that we were out
for a clean campaign?"</p>

<p>Gantry shook his head and his smile was commiserative.
"I know; and every man who has
had his fingers in the pitch-barrel has chuckled to
himself, and when two of them would get together
they'd pound each other on the back and swear that
you were the smoothest spellbinder that Mr. McVickar
has ever turned loose on this side of the big
mountains. It grinds, Evan, but it's the fact. Not
one of the men you are after has ever taken your
speeches seriously."</p>

<p>Blount's head sank lower.</p>

<p>"I'm smashed, Dick!" he groaned; "utterly and
irretrievably disgraced and discredited in my native
State! There isn't a man in the sage-brush
hills who would believe me under oath, after this."</p>

<p><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>"It's hard, Evan&#8212;damned hard!" said the traffic
manager, driven to repetition. "But grilling over it
doesn't get us anywhere. What are you going to do"?</p>

<p>"With the election only five days away, there is
nothing that can be done. I had you down, Dick;
I could have forced my point with the weapon I
had. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>Gantry wagged his head dubiously. "I'm not the
big boss, but I can tell you right now that, if you
could have shown me what I was fully expecting to
see, the wires between here and wherever Mr. McVickar's
private car happens to be would have been
kept pretty hot for a while." Then, upon second
thought: "Yes; I guess you could have pulled it off.
We couldn't stand for any such bill-boarding as you
were threatening to give us."</p>

<p>Blount turned to his desk, opened it, and began
to arrange his papers.</p>

<p>"You've been a good friend, after all, Dick," he
said, talking as he worked. "I'm going to ask you
to go one step farther and take charge of the funeral,
if you will. Find Mr. McVickar and wire him that
I've dropped out. I'll write him a resignation from
somewhere, when I have time."</p><p><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a></p>

<p>Gantry left his chair and came to stand beside
the quitter.</p>

<p>"Honestly, Evan," he said slowly, "I thought you
were a grown man. You'll forgive the mistake,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Blount turned upon his tormentor and swore
pathetically. "What's the use&#8212;what in the devil
is the use?" he rasped, when the outburst began to
grow measurably articulate. "You know as well as
I do what's been done to me, and who has done it.
Can I lift my hand to strike back, even if I had a
weapon to strike with?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can't. But you owe it to yourself,
and to a certain bright-minded young woman that
I know of, not to fly off the handle without at least
trying to see if you can't stay on. Wait a minute."
The railroad man took a turn up and down the floor,
head down and hands behind him. When he came
back to the desk end he began again. "Evan, who's
got those original papers?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a></p>
<p>"The man who blew up my safe, of course.
You've said you didn't hire him, and that leaves
only one alternative."</p>

<p>Gantry took the dummy packet from his pocket
and held one of the blank sheets up to the light of
the window. It was growing dusk, and when he
failed to discern what he was looking for, he turned
on the electric lights and tried again. At this the
script "T-C" water-mark was plainly visible, and
he showed it to Blount.</p>

<p>"That proves conclusively that the substitution
was made here in your own office. Whom do you
suspect?"</p>

<p>In a flash Blount remembered: how he had sent
Collins to get the packet out of the safe, the stenographer's
delay, the hasty sealing of the envelope,
and the suspicion which had been cut short by the
incoming of Ackerton.</p>

<p>"I know now who did it, and when it was done,"
he said. "The day before the office was broken
into I told Collins to bring <a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>me the papers from the
safe. What he brought me was that dummy&#8212;in a
freshly sealed envelope. I was going to open
the envelope, but just then Ackerton came in."</p>

<p>"All clear so far," said Gantry; and then: "Where
is Collins now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; he comes and goes pretty much
as he pleases when I'm not in town."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about him personally?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I do. His father was a bank cashier, and he
became a defaulter&#8212;of the easy-mark kind; the
kind that is too good-natured to look too curiously
at a friend's collateral. He would have gone over
the road if your father hadn't pulled him out by
main strength."</p>

<p>"I see," said Blount cynically. "And the son
has paid his father's debt to my father. But why
the safe-blowing?"</p>

<p>"Collins's face had to be<a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a> saved in some way. He
couldn't know that you meant to lock the dummy
up in the safety vault," returned Gantry, and then,
after a pause: "That's our one little ray of hope,
Evan."</p>

<p>"I don't see it."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Then I'll make it a bit plainer. If
some railroad burglar had cracked your safe, you
could confidently assume that the original letters
have been carefully cremated by this time, couldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"But if your father has them ... Evan, I don't
know any more than the man in the moon what he
wants them for, but the man in the street would
grin and tell you that your father was merely getting
ready to hold the railroad company up for something
it didn't want to part with."</p>

<p>"I'm letting you say it of my own flesh and blood,
Dick; and it shows you how badly broken I am.
After all, it doesn't lead anywhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. Let us suppose, just for the sake
of argument, that your father doesn't know how
much those letters mean to you&#8212;I know it's a pretty
hard thing to imagine, but we'll do it by main
strength and awkwardness. Let us suppose agai<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>n,
that being the case, that you go to him frankly and
show him in a few well-chosen words just where he
has landed you; tell him you've got to have those
letters&#8212;simply <i>got</i> to have them&#8212;to save your face.
I know your father, Evan, a good bit better than you
do; he'd give you the earth with a fence around it
if you should ask him for it."</p>

<p>Evan Blount got slowly out of his chair, stood up,
and put his hands upon the smaller man's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Dick, do you realize what you are doing for yourself
when you show me a possible way of getting
my weapon back?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Gantry's lips became a fine straight line and he
nodded.</p>

<p>"That's what made me walk the floor a few minutes
ago; I was trying to find out if I were big
enough. It's all right, Ebee; you go to it, and I'll
throw up my job and run a foot-race with the sheriff,
if I have to. Damn the job, anyway!" he finished
petulantly. "I'm tired of being a robber for
somebody else's pocket all the time!"</p>
<p><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a></p>
<p>Blount sat down again and put his face in his
hands. After a time he looked up to say: "I can't
let you outbid me in the open market, Dick. You
can't set the friendship peg any higher than I can."</p>

<p>Gantry crossed the room and recovered his top-coat
and hat from the chair where he had thrown
them.</p>

<p>"Don't you be a fool," he advised curtly.
"There's a railroad down in Peru that is going
bankrupt for the lack of a wide-awake, up-to-date
traffic man. I've had the offer on my desk for a
month, and I'm going to cable to-night. That lets
you out, whether you do or don't. But if you've
got the sense of a wooden Indian, you'll do as I've
said&#8212;and do it <i>pronto</i>. Your time's mighty short,
anyway. So long."</p>

<p>And before Blount could stop him he was gone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<h3><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>A STONE FOR BREAD</h3>


<p>Though he had eaten nothing since the early
breakfast in the service-car on the way to Lewiston,
Evan Blount let the dinner hour go by unnoted.
For a long time after Gantry had left him he sat
motionless, a prey to thoughts too bitter to find
expression in words; the dismaying thoughts of the
hard-pressed champion who has discovered that his
foes are of his own household.</p>

<p>Apart from the one great boyhood sorrow, a sorrow
which had been allowed unduly to magnify
itself with the passing years, he had never been
brought face to face with any of the hardnesses
which alone can make the soldier of life entirely
intrepid in the shock of battle. In the backward
glance he saw that his homeless youth had been,
none the less, a sheltered youth; that his father's
love and care had built and maintained invisible ramparts
which had hitherto shielded him. It was most
humiliating to find that the crumbling of the ramparts
was leaving him naked and shivering; to find
that he was so far out of touch with his pioneer
lineage as to be unable to stand alone.</p><p><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a></p>

<p>But there are better things in the blood of the
pioneers than a latter-day descendant of the continent-conquering
fathers may be able to discern in
the moment of defeat and disaster. Slowly, so
slowly that he did not recognize the precise moment
at which the tide of depression and wretchedness
reached its lowest ebb and turned to sweep him
back to a firmer footing, Blount found himself emerging
from the bitter waters. Gantry, the Gantry
whom he had been calling hard names, setting him
down as at best a lovable but wholly unprincipled
time-server, had pointed a possible way to retrieval,
heroically effacing himself that the way might be
unobstructed. With the warm blood leaping again,
Blount straightened himself in his chair. He would
go to his father, not as a son begging a boon, but as
a man demanding his rights. The machine had seen
fit to throw down the challenge by burglarizing his
office and robbing him. Very good; there were five
days remaining in which to strike back. He would
lift the challenge, and if his reasonable demand should
be refused, he would drop the railroad crusade and
break into the wider field of bossism and machine-made
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>majorities, ploughing and turning it up to the
light as he could.</p>

<p>The fiery resolution had scarcely been taken when
he heard the door of Collins's outer room open and
close, and a moment later the good-looking young
stenographer came in, bringing a breath of the crisp
autumn evening with him.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were back, Mr. Blount!" he
exclaimed. "I saw the office lights from the street,
and thought somebody had left them turned on. Is
there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"Yes; sit down," said Blount crisply, and then:
"Collins, what do you do with yourself when I am
out of town?"</p>

<p>"I stay here most of the time. I went out early
this afternoon, but I don't often do it."</p>

<p>"Were you here all day yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was there anything unu<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>sual going on?"</p>

<p>The young man looked away as if he expected to
find his answer in the farther corner of the room.</p>

<p>"I don't know as you'd call it unusual," he replied
half-hesitantly. "There were a good many callers.
Shall I bring you the list?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The stenographer went out to his desk and brought
back a slip of paper with the names.</p>

<p>"This man Gryson," said Blount, running his eye
over the memorandum, "I see you've got him down
four or five times. What did he want?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't tell me. But he was all kinds of
anxious to see you. That was why I telegraphed you;
I couldn't get rid of him any other way."</p>

<p>"Let me see the copy of the message."</p>

<p>Again Collins made a journey to his desk, returning
with the telegraph-impression book open at the
proper page. Blount glanced at the copy of the
brief message: "Thomas Gryson wants to know when
he can be sure of finding you here," and handed the
book back.</p>
<p><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a></p>
<p>"How did you send that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I sent it down to the despatcher's office by
Barney."</p>

<p>Blount nodded. The message had not reached
him; and its suppression was doubtless another move
in the subtle game.</p>

<p>"You say you couldn't find out what Gryson
wanted?" he pressed.</p>

<p>"He&#8212;he seemed to be all torn up about something;
couldn't say three words without putting a
cuss word in with them. The most I could get out
of him was that somebody was trying to double-cross
him."</p>

<p>Blount took a cigar from his pocket and lighted
it. He was faint for lack of food, but he absently
mistook the hunger for the tobacco craving.</p>

<p>"Collins," he said evenly, "you appear to forget
at times that you are working for a man who has
had some little experience with unwilling witnesses
in the cou<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>rts. You are not telling me the truth;
or, at least, you're not telling me all of it. Let's
have the part that you are keeping back."</p>

<p>"The&#8212;the last time he was in, he&#8212;he did talk a
little," faltered the young man. "He's got something
to sell, and he's f-fighting mad at Mr. Kittredge.
He said he was going to throw the gaff into
somebody damn' quick if Mr. Kittredge didn't wipe
off the slate and c-come across with the price."</p>

<p>"That is better," was the brief comment. "Now,
then, why did you lie to me in the first place?"</p>

<p>The stenographer shut his eyes and shrunk lower
in his chair, but he made no reply.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why you lied," Blount went on, less
harshly. "It was because you were told to. Isn't
that so?"</p>

<p>Collins nodded.</p>

<p>Reaching out quickly, Blount laid a hand on the
young man's knee. "Fred, what do you think of
a soldier who takes his pay from one side and fights
on the other? That is what you've been doing, you
know; it is what you did when you put a dozen
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>sheets of blank paper into an envelope the other
day&#8212;the day I sent you to get a file of letters
marked 'private' from the safe."</p>

<p>The culprit drew away from the touch of the hand
on his knee, and there was fear, and behind the fear
the courage of desperation, in his eyes when he lifted
them.</p>

<p>"You can give me the third degree if you want
to, Mr. Blount, but as long as I've got the breath
to say no, I'll never tell you the next thing you're
going to ask me!"</p>

<p>Blount sprang up and went to stand at the window.
There was a street arc-lamp swinging in its
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>high sling some distance below the window level, its
scintillant spark changing weirdly to blue and green
and back to blinding orange, and he stared so steadily
at it that his eyes were full of tears when he turned
to look down upon the waiting culprit.</p>

<p>"No, Collins; I'm not going to ask you the name
of the other master for whom you have thrown me
down," he said gravely; and then: "That's all&#8212;you
may go now."</p>

<p>The young man got up and groped for the hat
which had fallen from his hands to the floor and
rolled away out of reach.</p>

<p>"You mean that I'm to get my time-check?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No," he grated&#8212;the harshness returning suddenly.
"You are disloyal, and I know it; your
successor would probably be the same, and I
shouldn't know it."</p>
<p><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a></p>
<p>Nerved to the strident pitch now by the new
resolution, Blount hurriedly set his desk in order,
slammed it shut, and followed the stenographer to
the street level. In the avenue he hesitated for a
moment, the thoughts shuttling swiftly. In a flash
the inferences fell into place. Gantry had said that
his father was responsible for the time-killing journey
to Lewiston. Why had it been necessary? Was
it to keep him out of Gryson's way? What did the
ward-organizer have to communicate that made him
so anxious to secure an interview? Was that anxiety
the breach through which the wider field of corruption
might be reached?</p>

<p>Again swift decision came to its own and Blount
faced to the right, walking rapidly until he turned
in at the foot of the worn double flight of stairs
leading to the editorial rooms of <i>The Plainsman</i>.
Blenkinsop, the editor, a lean, haggard man with a
sallow face, coarse black hair worn always a little
longer than the prevailing cut, and deep-set, gloomy
eyes, was at his desk.</p>

<p>"Can you give me a few minutes of your time,
Blenkinsop?" the cal<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>ler asked shortly.</p>

<p>"I can sell 'em to you, maybe," said the editor,
and the lift of the gloomy eyes merely served to
turn the jest into a bit of morbid sarcasm. Then
he gave the sarcasm a half-bitter twist: "You railroad
gentlemen are always willing to buy what you
can't reach out and take."</p>

<p>"I know that is what you believe," said Blount,
drawing up a broken chair and planting himself
carefully in it; "we are on opposite sides of the
fence in this fight, if you are fighting the railroad
merely because it is a railroad; otherwise, perhaps,
we are not so far apart as we might be. I don't
know whether or not you have listened to any of
my speeches, but you've printed a good many of
them."</p>

<p>The editor nodded. "I've read 'em, and I'm
willing to be the hundredth man and say that I believe
you are individually honest. I hope you're
not going to ask me to go any further than
that."</p>

<p>"I'm not; I came for quite another purpose.<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>
First, let me ask a frank question: Is <i>The Plainsman</i>
out for a square deal all around, regardless of who
may be hit?"</p>

<p>Blenkinsop took time to consider the question and
his answer, chewing thoughtfully upon his extinct
cigar while he reflected.</p>

<p>"This is straight goods?" he asked finally.
"You're not trying to pull me into an admission
that can be used against us a little later on?"</p>

<p>"At the present moment you are talking to Evan
Blount, the man, and not to the Transcontinental
company's lawyer, Blenkinsop."</p>

<p>"All right; then I'll tell you flat that we are out
for blood. We hold no brief for any living man.
There are no strings tied to us, and we wear nobody's
brass collar."</p>

<p>"Then you are fighting the machine as well as
the railroad?" Blount put in quickly.</p>

<p>The editor sat back in his cha<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>ir, and the two furrows
which deepened upon either side of his hard-bitted
mouth answered for a smile.</p>

<p>"When you find a machine that hasn't got
'T-C.R.' lettered on it somewhere, you let us
know about it," was his rather cryptic reply.</p>

<p>"That is not the point," said Blount dryly.
"Here is the question I wanted to ask: There are
only five days intervening before the election. How
wide a swath could you cut if the evidence of wholesale
corruption could be placed in your hands within
twenty-four hours?"</p>

<p>Again the editor took time to consider. When he
spoke it was to say: "I can't quite believe that you
are going to be disloyal to your salt at this late
stage of the game, Blount. Do you mean that you
are going to show your own company up for what
it really is?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. I asked a question, and
you haven't answered it."</p>

<p>"It was a question of time, wasn't it? There's
time enough to tip the skillet over and spill all the
grease into the fire, if that's what you mean; always
time enough, up to the l<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>ast issue before the polls
open."</p>

<p>"And you'd do it&#8212;no matter who might happen
to get in the way of the burning grease?"</p>

<p>"We print the news, and we try to get all the news
there is. But it would have to be straight goods,
Blount; no 'ifs' and 'ands' about it. I'm not saying
that you couldn't produce the goods, you know.
If you could break into Gantry's and Kittredge's
private files, the trick would be turned. But I know
well enough you're not going to do that."</p>

<p>Blount got up out of the broken chair and buttoned
his coat.</p>

<p>"I needn't take any more of your time just now,"
he said. "I merely wanted to know how far you'd
go if somebody should happen along at the last moment
and give you a plain map of the road."</p>

<p>"We'll go as far, and drive as hard, as any newspaper
this side of the Missouri River. But we've
got to have the facts&#8212;don't forget that."</p>

<p>Blount was turning to go, but he faced around
again sharply.</p>
<p><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a></p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me, Blenkinsop, that you
don't know, as well as you know you're alive, that
this campaign is honeycombed with deals and trades
and dishonesty and trickery in every legislative district?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>Again the ghastly smile which was only a deepening
of the natural furrows flitted across the editor's
face.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know it," he returned. "But you'll
excuse me if I say that I scarcely expected to have
the railroad company's field-manager come and tell
me about it."</p>

<p>Blount's grim smile was a match for the editorial
face-wrinkling. "You are like a good many others,
Blenkinsop; you see red when you hear the noise
of a railroad train. Perhaps, a little later, I may
be able to persuade you to see another color&#8212;yellow,
for example. Let it go at that. Good-night."</p>

<p>Once more in the avenue, Blount turned his steps
toward the Inter-Mountain. Since the campaign<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>
was now in its final week, the clans were gathering
in the capital, and the lobby of the great hotel was
filled with groups of caucussing politicians. Blount
was halted half a dozen times before he could make
his way to the room-clerk's desk, and the pumping
process to which he was subjected at each fresh stoppage
would have amused him if the fiery resolution
which was driving him on had not temporarily
killed his sense of humor. It was evident that, in
spite of all he had been saying and doing, a considerable
majority of the caucussers were still regarding
him as his father's lieutenant. He did not try very
hard to remove the impression. It mattered little,
in the present crisis, what the various party henchmen
thought or believed.</p>

<p>It was a sharp disappointment when the room-clerk
told him that his father and Mrs. Honoria and
their guest had gone to the theatre. He was keyed
to the fighting-pitch, and he wanted to have the
deciding word spoken while his blood was up and
there was still time to act. A glance at the clock
showed him that he had a full half-hour to wait; and,
as much to escape the buzzing lobbyists as to satisfy
his hunger, he went to the <i>café</i> and ordered a belated
dinner, choosing a table from which he could
look out through the open doors and command the
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>main entrance through which the theatre-goers would
return.</p>

<p>He was through with the dinner, and was slowly
sipping his black coffee, when he saw them come in.
Since it was no part of his plan to dull the edge of
opportunity by holding it first upon the social grindstone,
he let the party of three go on to the elevators,
and a little later sent a card up-stairs asking his father
to meet him in the lounge on the mezzanine floor.</p>

<p>Having the advantage of time, he was first at the
appointed meeting-place. He had drawn a chair
to the balustrade, and was glooming thoughtfully
down at the lobby gathering, upon which even the
lateness of the hour appeared to have no dispersing
effect, when a mellow voice behind him said: "Well,
son, taking a quiet little squint at the menagerie?"</p>

<p>Blount got up and gave the speaker his chair,
dragging up another for himself. The senator sat
down and stretched his great frame like a man
wearied. "Ah, Lord!" he said. "The old man isn't
as young as he used to be, Evan, boy. There was
a time once when eleven o'clock didn't seem any
later to me than it does now to you; but it's gone
by, son, and I don't reckon it'll ever come back
again."</p>

<p>Blount drew his chair nearer. "I have a hard
thing to say to you to-night, dad," he began, "and
you mustn't make it harder by speaking of your&#8212;of
the things that get near to me. I am a man
grown, and a Blount, like yourself; I want you to
give me back those papers which your dynamiter
or somebody else in your pay took from my offic<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>e
safe three nights ago."</p>

<p>The senator's eyes lighted with the gentle smile,
and the tips of the great mustaches twitched slightly.</p>

<p>"So McVickar's been telling tales out of school,
has he?" he inquired half-jocularly.</p>

<p>"I have had no communication with Mr. McVickar.
It wasn't necessary, nor is it needful for
us to go aside out of the straight road. I want those
papers. They are mine, and they were stolen."</p>

<p>The elder man smiled again. "What if I should
say that I haven't got 'em, son&#8212;what then?" he
asked mildly.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to say that. I want to believe
that, however bitter this fight may grow, we shall
still speak the truth to each other."</p>

<p>There was silence for a little time, and then the
father broke it to say: "Reckon I could ask you
what papers you mean, without roiling the water
any more than it's already been roiled, son?"</p>

<p>"You may ask and I'll answer, if you'll let me say
that it is hardly worth while for you to spar with me
to gain time. I had certain documents&#8212;letters&#8212;which
would have enabled me to come through clean
with my own people&#8212;with the railroad management.
You knew I had them; I was imprudent enough to
boast of it one evening when we were dining together
in your rooms. I know what I'm talking about,
dad, when I make this <a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>demand of you. One of my
clerks has been tampered with. Three days ago,
when I asked him to bring me the letters from the
safe, he brought me, instead, a packet of blank
paper which he allowed me to go and lock up in
my safety-box in the Sierra National. I don't know
why you had the safe blown up, unless it was to
save Collins's face."</p>

<p>Again a silence intervened, and in the midst of
it the senator sat up and began to feel half-absently
in his pockets for a cigar. Blount offered his own
pocket-case, following it with the tender of a lighted
match. With the cigar going, the Honorable David
settled back in the deep chair, chuckling thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"They wrote me from back yonder on the Eastern
edge of things that you had the makings of a mighty
fine lawyer in you, boy, and I'll be switched if I
don't believe they had it about right. The way
you've trailed this thing out doesn't leave the old
man a hole as big as a dog-burrow to crawl out of,
does it, now? Reckon you've sure-enough got to
have those papers back before you can go on, do
you?"</p>

<p>"You know I must. You know what I've been
preaching and talking: I have<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a> meant every word of it
in good faith, and when I began to doubt the good
faith of those behind me, I was forced to cast about
for a weapon. It was handed to me almost miraculously,
and as long as I held it my good name before
the people of the State was safe. As the matter
stands now, I'm a broken man, dad. After the
election I shall be billeted from one end of the State
to the other as the most shameless liar that ever
breathed!"</p>

<p>The senator was rocking his great head slowly
upon the chair-pillow. "That's bad; that's mighty
bad, son. I reckon we'll have to fix some way to
trail you out of that bog-hole, sure enough!"</p>

<p>"I'm not asking for help; I'm asking for bare justice.
Give me those papers and I'll fight myself
clear."</p>

<p>"And if I say I can't give 'em to you, Evan, boy,
what then?"</p>

<p>"Then, hard and unfilial as it may seem to you,
I shall fight you and your machine to a finish. You
think I can't do it? I'll show you. I've got five
days, and they are all my own. This campaign has<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>
been rotten to the core from the very beginning.
You have tried to keep me from finding it out, and
you have partly succeeded. But I know a little, and
inside of the next twenty-four hours I shall know
more. That's my last word, dad, and it breaks my
heart to have to say it. But, by the God who made
us both, if you drive me to it, I shall stir up such a
revolution in this State that the people will forget
to curse me for the lies I have been allowed to tell
them!"</p>

<p>Blount was upon his feet when he finished, and
<a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>the senator was rising stiffly from the depths of the
big chair.</p>

<p>"That's good, man-sized talk, son," he commented
gently, "and I reckon I haven't a word to
say against it. All I'm going to beg for is this:
we're kin, boy&#8212;mighty close kin. Belt away as
hard as you like in the big scrap; it does me good
to see that all these little Eastern frills haven't
made you any less a two-fisted, hard-hitting Blount;
but don't let it make you turn your back when
your old daddy comes into the room. That's all I
ask. Now you'd better go to bed and sleep up
some. There's another day coming, and if there
isn't, none of these little things we've been haggling
over is going to count for much to any of us."</p>

<p>Three minutes later the Honorable Senator Sage-Brush
was letting himself into the sitting-room of
his suite on the private dining-room floor by means
of his night-key. The small person whom Gantry
and a few others were still calling the court of last
resort was sitting up, and the tiny embroidery-frame
on the table had evi<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>dently just been laid
aside.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said inquiringly.</p>

<p>The senator shook his head in patient tolerance.</p>

<p>"Whatever you've been doing, it's knocked the
bottom clean out for the boy, Honoria. For a little
spell he had me going, and I thought I'd just naturally
have to turn loose and spill all the fat into the
fire."</p>

<p>"You mustn't do that," she returned quickly.
"There are five days yet, and I need at least three
of them. He was very angry?"</p>

<p>"Fighting mad."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the small one thoughtfully.
"But we can't allow that to get in the way of the
bigger things. It won't make any family break, will
it? For Patricia's sake I shall be sorry if he is
desperate enough to make the quarrel a personal
one."</p>

<p>"I did the best I could on that, little woman, and
I reckon he's big enough to keep on telling us
'Howdy.' What comes <a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>next on the programme?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow I'm going to try to get him to take
Patricia driving. Beyond that I haven't planned,
and anyway it doesn't matter, now that you have
Gryson out of the way." Then she offered a bit
of news. "Richard Gantry telephoned me a few
minutes ago. He has sent in his resignation, and is
going to Peru."</p>

<p>The senator was opening the door to the adjoining
bedroom and turning on the lights.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I reckon not," he rejoined, with a mellow
laugh rumbling deep in his great body. "Dick
only thinks he is going to Peru. We all think such
things now and then."</p>

<h3>THE UNDER-DOG</h3>


<p>Blount's first move on the morning following the
militant interview with his father was telegraphic;
he wired the campaign chairmen in the three towns
remaining on his list, cancelling his speaking-engagements.
Beyond that he went forth to institute a
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>painstaking search in the purlieus of the city, a quest
having for its object the unearthing of the man
Thomas Gryson. More and more he was coming to
believe that this man was the key to a larger situation
in the field of political corruption than any
which had as yet developed. Wherefore he made
the search thorough.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, considering the man and his habits,
the quest proved fruitless. Blount was too clean
a man to be on familiar terms with the saloon men
and dive-keepers of the capital-city underworld, or
with the crooks and turnings of the underworld itself;
but he found his way around easily enough in
daylight, and had his labor for his pains. For when
he went back to the hotel at the luncheon-hour he
brought little with him save a stench in his nostrils
and a slightly increased fund of mystification. Gryson
had disappeared as completely as if the earth
had opened and swallowed him. And Blount knew
the disappearance was real, because the ward-heeler's
own henchmen were searching for him.</p>

<p>Daunted but not beaten, Blount meant to continue
the quest in the afternoon. But man proposes,
and a small <i>dea ex machina</i> may dispose. At the
<i>café</i> family luncheon, at which Blount was c<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>areful
to make his appearance, not only because Patricia
was there, but also for the sake of keeping the kinsman
peace his father had begged for, it transpired
that Patricia had been promised an auto drive to
Fort Parker, the military reservation sixteen miles
to the westward, and that there were difficulties.
The senator's wife took his arm and explained her
dilemma at the table dispersal.</p>

<p>"It is parade day at the Fort, you know, and
Patricia has set her heart on going. I don't know
how I came to be so absurdly thoughtless, but I
promised her before I remembered that this is the
Kismet Club election afternoon, and if I don't go,
they'll make me president again in spite of everything,"
she said in low tones as they were leaving
the <i>café</i>. "I simply <i>can't</i> serve another year; and
at the same time, I do so dislike to disappoint Patricia.
She is such a dear girl!" Mrs. Honoria was
strictly within the bounds of truth in claiming to
have forgotten the date of the Kismet election of
officers; but it was equally true that the club would
re-elect her, present or absent, since she was its
founder and chief patroness.</p>

<p>Blount saw the pointing of all this with perfect
clarity, and he had no need to assure himself that
it had every ear-mark of another expedient to get
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>him out of the way. But while he was with Mrs.
Honoria and listening to her persuasive little appeals
it was much harder to maintain the antagonistic
attitude than it was when she figured&#8212;at
a distance&#8212;merely as his father's second wife and
his mother's supplanter. Foolish? Oh, yes; but at
times when the star of impulse is in the ascendant
every man hath a fool in his sleeve.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> too bad to disappoint her," he found himself
saying, matching the little lady's low tone. "If I
wasn't so terribly busy&#8212;"</p>

<p>"I know; and just now, with the election so near,
you must be busier than ever. I suppose I shall
have to explain to Patricia, and it hurts me, when
she is going home so soon."</p>

<p>"Going home?" echoed the victim.</p>

<p>"Yes; in a few days now. The professor has
already overstayed his leave of absence, so he says."</p>

<p>Blount clenched a figurative fist and shook it savagely
at an unkind fate. Nevertheless, he fell.</p>

<p>"If you can shift your responsibility to my shoulders,
Mrs. Blount&#8212;" he began, but she would not
let him finish.</p>
<p><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a></p>
<p>"Oh! that is <i>so</i> good of you, Evan. Take the
little car, and be sure to ask the garage man to put
in new batteries. The magneto isn't working very
well. And be here by half past one if you can.
The parade is at half past two, you know."</p>

<p>Under other conditions the railroad company's
"social secretary," as the society editors of the capital
were still calling him, might have had a joyous
half-holiday. The autumn afternoon was picture-fine,
the little car ran well, and Patricia's mood was
tempered with the gayety which strives to extract
the final thrill of enjoyment out of the closing days
of a delightful vacation. Blount was grateful for
the light-hearted mood. He felt that it would be
next to impossible to tell Patricia how wretchedly
he had failed in the single-handed crusade, and, as
to the desperate alternative, there could be no confidences
with one whose every reference to his father
was shot through with loving and loyal admiration.</p>

<p>At the military reservation there were fewer opportunities
for the confidences, or rather fewer temptations
to indulge in them. It was a gala day at
the post, and there were a number of auto parties
out from the city. Blount knew most of the officers
and their wives, and Patricia was welcomed not less
for her own sake than for the reason that she had
figured in former visits as the <i>protégée</i> of an ex-senator's
wife. After the parade there was an impromptu
game of baseball, with the broad verandas of the
officers' quarters servin<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>g for the grandstand. Beyond
the game there was tea, and the sunset gun
had been fired before the young lieutenant, who had
attached himself to Miss Anners at the earliest possible
moment in the afternoon, reluctantly surrendered
his prize and handed Patricia into the waiting
runabout for the return to the capital.</p>

<p>"We shall be late for dinner, if we don't hurry,"
was the young woman's comment when Blount
steered the little car clear of the post settlement and
took the road well in the wake of the Weatherford
touring machine. Then she added: "We mustn't
be; we are dining out this evening&#8212;at the Gordons."</p>

<p>Blount was entirely willing to hurry. Half of one
of the precious days of challenge had been wasted
in the futile search for Gryson, and here was the
other half worse than wasted, since the handsome
young lieutenant had so brazenly monopolized Patricia.</p>

<p>"I'll get you home in time for dinner, never fear,"
he returned, but apparently the little car was no
party to the promise. A short mile from the reservation
the motor began to miss, and a few minutes
farther along it stopped altogether. Blount got out
and began to investigate. There was plenty of gasolene,
but the spark appeared to be dead.</p>

<p>"I ought t<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a>o have a leather medal!" he confided
to Patricia, in great disgust. "Mrs. Blount told
me that the batteries needed to be changed, and I
had them changed, but neglected to have them
tested. Sit still and let me spin it on the magneto
a while."</p>

<p>She let him do it until the perspiration was standing
in fine little beads on his forehead and he was
hot and desperate. Then she said sweetly: "I don't
believe I'd wear myself out that way, if I were you,
Evan. Something happened to the magneto two
or three weeks ago, and it has never been fixed."</p>

<p>Blount pushed his driving-cap back, mopped his
face, and came around to dive once more into the
wiring in the battery box. Dusk was coming on,
and he had to light one of the side-lamps to serve
as a lantern. By changing the wiring he was finally
able to evoke a desultory response from the spark-coil,
and a little later to start the motor after some
limping fashion.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor dinner!" said Miss Anners, who was
still in the light-hearted mood; this after Blount's
careful nursing had resulted in a creeping resumption
of the cityward progress. And then: "I hope
you didn't have any engagement for this evening?"</p>

<p>"I have but one ambition in life," he rejoined
grimly, "and that is to get you back to the hotel
in time for your engagement. Surely Mrs. Blount
will wait for you."</p>
<p><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a></p>
<p>At the rate they were going the waiting promised
to be long. But after another half-hour had been
killed, the headlights of a westward-driven car appeared
in the road ahead. Blount pulled quickly
into the ditch and jumped out to flag the oncoming
machine; did flag it, and was able to borrow a set
of batteries. With the new equipment the remainder
of the drive was accomplished swiftly, but not swiftly
enough. At the Inter-Mountain they found that
the senator and Mrs. Honoria had gone to keep their
dinner engagement, and a note in the little lady's
copperplate handwriting informed Blount that the
invitation had been made to include him, and that
he was to hurry and bring Patricia.</p>

<p>Fully alive now to the time-killing purpose of the
clever little machinator in arranging to have spent
batteries given him, Blount, nevertheless, did his
duty like a man, and the pair made a late descent
upon the Gordon dinner-table. Though the dinner
was informal, there were other guests besides the
senator's party, and among them the traffic manager.
Blount, sitting next to Patricia, made their tardiness
an excuse and devoted himself to her, thus escaping
the toils of the general table-talk, which was frankly
political. But at the adjournment to the drawing-room
he cornered Gantry.</p><p><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a></p>

<p>"I meant to hunt you up this afternoon," he began,
"but I was otherwise spoken for. What have you
done?"</p>

<p>"I've cabled a conditional acceptance of the offer
I was telling you about."</p>

<p>"But you haven't resigned?"</p>

<p>"No. Mr. McVickar will probably be here within
a day or two, and I'll make it verbal."</p>

<p>Yielding to the urgings of the younger Gordon,
Patricia was going to the piano, and Blount snatched
at his opportunity.</p>

<p>"Give me a few minutes in the smoking-room,"
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>he said to the traffic manager, and when the privacy
was secured: "You needn't resign, Dick. There
isn't going to be any earthquake&#8212;of the kind you
were fearing."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that the Honorable Senator has
turned you down, Evan?"</p>

<p>"Just that."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said the friend in need, feeling his
way cautiously. Then he added: "You needn't
tell me anything more than you want to, you know."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell. I asked for bare justice,
and it was refused."</p>

<p>"Your father has the papers?"</p>

<p>"He neither admitted nor denied."</p>

<p>"But you didn't quarrel?"</p>

<p>Blount's smile was mirthless. "We are here together,
as you see. After all is said, we are still
father and son."</p><p><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></p>

<p>"Of course; that's as it should be, Evan. What
are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know: go on fighting until I'm wiped
out, I suppose. And that reminds me: have you
seen that fellow Gryson within the last day or two?"</p>

<p>Gantry dropped into the depths of a lounging-chair
and lighted a cigarette. "So you're after
Thomas Matthew, too, are you? Kittredge has been
ransacking the town for him all day, and up to a
couple of hours ago he hadn't found him. What's
in the wind?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I mean to find out. What
can you tell me about Gryson&#8212;more than you have
already told me?"</p>

<p>"Not very much, I guess. He's a scalawag, of
course, but unhappily for all of us he is a scalawag
with a pull. Kittredge has been dickering with him&#8212;I
don't mind telling you that now."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of the pull?"</p>

<p>"Votes," said Gantry succinctly.</p>

<p><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>"Straight or crooked?"</p>

<p>"You may search me. But knowing Tom Gryson
a little, I should put my money on the marked
card."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Blount dryly. "Still, I am needing
to be shown. I've had two or three chances
to size Gryson up, and he didn't impress me as a
man with any ability beyond the requirements of a
bully and the lowest type of a political heeler."</p>

<p>"Tom is bigger than that; I don't know how
much bigger, but some. He has votes to sell, and
Kittredge, at least, seems to believe that he can
deliver the goods. I don't know the inside of the
deal. I'll tell you frankly that I tried to shove it
over to you, neck and heels, at first. When that
little notion failed, I pushed it along to Kittredge."</p>

<p>Blount's eyebrows, which promised in time to be
as portentous as the Honorable Senator's, met in a
frown. "I'm going to find Gryson, dead or alive,"
he said.</p>

<p>Gantry looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Which means that you know what has become
of him?"</p>

<p>"He has been put out of the way for a purpose,<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a>
and the purpose is to keep me from finding out
something that Gryson wants to tell me. That was
the animus of the scheme to send me on a fool's
errand to Lewiston. After you left me last night I
found out that Gryson had been worrying Collins
the day before; had been in the office a number of
times and was sweatingly anxious about something."</p>

<p>Gantry flung his cigarette away and lighted another.
After a deep inhalation or two he said: "Let
it alone, Evan. I have a hunch that you'll be happier
if you don't try to drag the cover off of that
particular cesspool."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Blount shortly. "When my father
turned me down last night I told him that I still
had five days in which to&#8212;"</p>

<p>"I know," Gantry nodded. "Just the same,
you're not going to do it."</p>

<p>"If I don't, it will be because I can't; because
the time is too short." Then, with a sudden and
impulsive gesture of appeal: "Dick, for Heaven's
sake help me to find that man Gryson, if you know
where he is! I shall blow up if I can't do something!"</p>

<p>Gantry rose and tossed the second cigare<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a>tte among
the coals in the grate.</p>

<p>"I've been afraid all along that they'd corner you
and beat you to death with feather-dusters," he lamented.
"And the only thing I can say will make
matters worse instead of better. I have it pretty
straight that Gryson has been fired&#8212;shooed out of
town, and probably out of the State."</p>

<p>"Who did it, Gantry?"</p>

<p>"There is only one man in this bailiwick who can
take the whip to a fellow like Tom Gryson. I guess
I don't need to name him for you, Evan."</p>

<p>Blount got out of his chair and stood with his
back to the fire, and his face was white.</p>

<p>"Good God! the rottenness of it, Dick!" he
groaned. And then: "I've got to get out of this
and begin all over again in some corner of the world
where at least one man in ten hasn't forgotten the
meaning of common honesty and decency and fair
dealing. Heaven knows I'm no saint, but if I stay
here this cursed crookedness will get into my blood
and I'll be just as degraded as the worst of them.
No, I'm not raving; there have been times when
I've felt myself slipping&#8212;times when I've been
tempted to get down and fight with the weapons
that everybody <a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a>fights with in this God-forsaken,
law-breaking, graft-ridden commonwealth!"</p>

<p>Gantry had risen and he was slowly shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"You're hot now&#8212;and with good enough cause,
I guess. But that sort of a temperature makes a
man near-sighted and color-blind. Human nature
is pretty much the same the world over, Evan, and
if you could see beyond the crookedness you'd find
a lot of good people out here, averaging about the
same as the decent majority anywhere. It's an inarticulate
majority generally; it doesn't stand up
on its hind legs and rear around and call attention
to itself&#8212;couldn't if it should try. But it's here
and there and everywhere in America, just the
same. A railroad car with one drunken fool in it
gives you the idea. You focus on him and say,
'What a beastly shame!' and you entirely overlook
the other fifty-odd people in the car who are quietly
minding their own business."</p>

<p>Blount's smile was for the man rather than for
the theory.</p>

<p>"You are an implacable optimist, Dick, and you
always have been," he returned. "Your theory is
good humanitarianism, and I wish I could accept
it as applying to this abandoned community out
here in my native hills; but I can't. Let's go back
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>to the others. We've established a sort of family
<i>modus vivendi</i>, my father and I, and I don't want
him to think that I'm breaking it by plotting with
you."</p>

<p>It was while the evening was still measurably
young that Blount made his excuses to his hostess
and got away, fondly believing that he was escaping
without attracting the attention of the small
lady who was deep in a political discussion with
candidate Gordon at the critical moment. He was
mistaken, but the escape was not interrupted. At
the curb the Blount touring-car was waiting, with
two others, and for an instant Blount hesitated,
half inclined to ask his father's chauffeur, to drive
him down-town. On such inconsequent pivots fate,
or accident, twirls the most momentous affairs of
life. If Blount had taken the car he would have
been driven directly to the hotel. As it was, he
walked, and in passing the Temple Court Building
he remembered that he had not seen his mail since
early morning.</p>

<p>Rousing the sleepy boy in charge of the all-night
elevator, he had himself lifted to his office floor.
The upper corridor was dimly lighted, and on leaving
the car he went directly to the door of his private
room, walking swiftly and neither seeing nor hearing
a man who, materializing mysteriously out of
the corridor shadows, followed him step by step.</p><p><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a></p>

<p>In the office Blount snapped the lights on and
turned to unlock his desk. As the key clicked in the
lock the sixth sense, which is perhaps only a mingling
of the subtler essences of the other five, warned
him sharply, and he wheeled to face the door which
had been left on the latch. As he looked, the door
opened silently and the materializing shadow, haggard
of face and with bloodshot eyes mirroring blind
rage and the terror of a cornered rat, slipped into the
room and stood warily aside out of the direct light
from the electric chandelier. Blount looked again
and swore softly. The dodging intruder was the
man Thomas Gryson.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII</h2>

<h3>THE ICONOCLAST</h3>


<p>It is a threadbare saying that the environment
moulds the man. Yet, much more than the philosophers
have contended, there are chameleon tendencies
in the strongest character, and one finely determining
to coerce his surroundings is quite likely to
end by realizing that the surroundings have appealed
to unsuspected color-changings in himself. Thus it
may chance that the fairest fighter, finding himself
sufficiently kicked and cuffed in the rough-and-tumble,
will discover how facilely easy it is to descend
to the level of his antagonists, and from this
discovery to the awakening of the re<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a>morseless passion
for success at any price is but a step, long or
short according to the exigencies of the struggle.</p>

<p>Checked in his luggage, if not precisely pinned
openly upon his sleeve, Blount had brought with
him from the scholastic banks of the Charles a
choice assortment of ideals, which are things precious
only as they can be preserved inviolate. But
for weeks, endless weeks as they seemed to him in the
retrospect, he had been rubbing shoulders with a
crude world which appeared to care little for ideals
and less for the man who upheld them. Inevitably,
as he had admitted to Gantry, the change was
wrought, or working; the exclamation springing to
his lips when he recognized Gryson evinced it, and
when he beckoned the shifty intruder to the chair
at the desk end the ruthless <i>zeitgeist</i> had taken full
possession of him, and the thought uppermost had
grown suddenly indifferent to the means if by their
employment the end might be gained.</p>

<p>"Come over here and sit down," he commanded;
then, seeing that Gryson hesitated and flung a glance
over his shoulder at the door: "What are you afraid
of?"</p>

<p>"They've got my number," said the ward-heeler,
in a convict whisper which was little more than a
facial contortion. "There's a couple o' bulls waitin'
f'r me down on the sidewalk."</p>
<p><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a></p>
<p>Blount crossed the room, shut the door and locked
it. Then he went back to the self-confessed fugitive.</p>

<p>"You're safe for the time being," he told the man.
"Now talk fast and talk straight. What do you
want this time?"</p>

<p>Gryson hammered the arm of his chair with his
fist and babbled profanity. When he became coherent
he told his story, or rather Blount got it out
of him piecemeal, of how he had been employed by
the "organization" to falsify the registration lists
in certain districts; of how, when the work was
done, he had been denied the price and driven out
with cursings. In the accusation, which was shot
through with tremulous imprecations, the "organization"
and the railroad company were implicated
as if they were one. In one breath the fugitive
charged the "double-crossing" to Kittredge, and in
the next he accused the "big boss" himself, of having
passed the sentence of deportation.</p>

<p>"You say you were driven out? How could they
drive you if you didn't want to go?" queried the
cross-examiner.</p>
<p><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a></p>
<p>"That's on me: it was a job I pulled off two years
ago in another place&#8212;up north of this&#8212;and the
night-watchman got in the way when I was leavin'.
They jerked that on me and showed me th' rope.
They had me by th' neck, with th' word passed to
Chief Robertson. I'm back here now wit' my life
in my hand, but I'd chance it twice over to get square
wit' them welshers that have bawled me out!"</p>

<p>"Why have you come to me?" asked Blount
briefly.</p>

<p>"Gawd knows; I took a chance again. I've
heard your speeches, and says I, 'There's your wan
chance, cully,' and I'm here to grab f'r it. If you've
been meanin' the half of what you've been sayin',
Mr. Blount&#8212;" There was more of it, half pleadings
and half mere rageful babblings of a vengeful soul
hampered by the tongue of inadequacy.</p>

<p>Blount left his chair and began to pace the floor,
with Gryson watching him furtively. At any time
earlier in the struggle the thought of using this
wretched time-server as a means to any end, however
desirable and just, would have been nauseating.
True, if there could be any such thing as honor
among thieves, the man had earned the price of his
crooked work among the registration clerks; but f<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>or
another man to profit by the broken bargain, and
by the confessed criminal's rage and lust for vengeance,
was a thing to make even a hard-pressed
loser in an unequal battle hesitate.</p>

<p>The hesitation was only momentary. With a
gesture which was more expressive than many words,
Blount turned short upon the furtive watcher in the
chair at the desk end.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You're on before I could stall it f'r you. You've
been swearin' you'd back th' square deal to th' limit;
it ain't square; it's crooked as hell. Grab f'r this
knife I'm handin' you and cut the heart out o' these
welshin' bosses that are givin' you th' double-cross
the same as they're givin' it to me. You're the
on'y man that can do it; the on'y man on Gawd's
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>green earth they're afraid of. I know it damn' well.
That's why they handed my number to th' chief
and passed th' word to have me pinched. They was
afraid I'd come here and squeal to you!"</p>

<p>Blount stopped him with an impatient gesture.
"Let that part of it rest and get down to business.
What you have been telling me may be true, but I
can't do anything on your bare word&#8212;the word of a
man who is dodging the police. You've got to bring
me proofs in black and white; lists of the faked
names, and a straight-out give-away of how they
are to be used; names and dates, and a written story
of your bargainings with the men higher up. This
is Thursday; to be of any use, these documents
would have to be in my hands by Saturday noon,
at the latest. You know best whether the thing
can be done in time&#8212;or done at all. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>For a little time Gryson said nothing. When he
spoke it was evident that the lust for vengeance and
a guilty conscience were fighting an even-handed
battle.</p><p><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a></p>

<p>"I could get the affidavits&#8212;maybe," he said.
"There's a dozen 'r more of the cullies down-along
got their notice to fade away when I got mine, and
they'd jump at th' chance to get back at the bosses.
But f'r Gawd's sake, look at what it means to me!
Anny minute I'm on the job I'd be lookin' to see
some bull with a star on 'im holdin' a gun on me;
and after that, it's this f'r mine"&#8212;with a jerk of
the head and a pantomimic gesture simulating the
hangman's knot under his ear.</p>

<p>"That is your risk," said Blount coldly, making
this small concession to the expiring sense of
uprightness. "You know how badly you want to 'get
square,' as you put it, and I am interested only in
the results. If you get caught, I sha'n't turn my
hand over to help you&#8212;you can take that straight.
But if you show up here with the proofs, proofs that
I can use, any time before Saturday night, I'll
undertake to see that you get safely out of the
State."</p>

<p>It was in the little pause which followed that
some one in the corridor rapped smartly on the locked
door. At the sound, Gryson collapsed and his face
became an ashen mask of fear. Blount, the law-abiding,
might have hesitated, but this newer Blount
had <a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>slain his scruples. Snatching Gryson out of his
chair, he thrust him silently through the half-open
door of the work-room, and a moment later he was
answering the rap at the corridor entrance, opening
the door and calmly facing the two policemen on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said brusquely.</p>

<p>One of the men touched his helmet.</p>

<p>"We're looking for a felly that ducked in below
a couple of hours ago, Mr. Blount. He's in the
building, somewheres, and your office being lighted,
we thought maybe you'd&#8212;"</p>

<p>Blount threw the door wide.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourselves," he said. "Would
you like to come in and look around?"</p>

<p>"Sure not; your word's as good as the search,
Mr. Blount. 'Twas only on the chance that he
might have faked an excuse and ducked in on you
to be out of reach."</p><p><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></p>

<p>Blount left the door open and went to get his
coat and hat.</p>

<p>"Who is the man?" he asked, while the officers
lingered.</p>

<p>"A felly named Gryson. He's been working in
the railroad shops what times he wasn't pullin' off
something crooked in the p'litical line."</p>

<p>"What is he wanted for?" Blount was closing his
desk and preparing to leave the office.</p>

<p>"Croaking a bank watchman up in Montana afther
he'd souped the vault door for a kick-shot."</p>

<p>"In that case, perhaps I'm lucky that he didn't
drop in and croak me," laughed Blount, turning off
the lights and joining the two men in the corridor.
And then: "There is a back stair to the engine-room
in the basement in the other wing of the
building: have you been watching that?"</p>

<p>The bigger of the two policemen prodded the other
in the ribs with his night-stick. "That's on us,
Jakey. He'll have been gone hours ago. Let's be
drilling. 'Tis a fine mind ye have, Mr. Blount, to
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a>be thinking of thim back stairs right off the bat."
And the pair went down in the elevator with Blount,
chuckling to themselves at their own discomfiture.</p>

<p>Having set his hand to the plough, Blount did nothing
carelessly. Sauntering slowly, and even pausing
to light a cigar, he trailed the two policemen until
they were safely in another street. Then he turned
back to the great office building and once more had
himself lifted to the upper floor. In the office
corridor he waited until the car had dropped out of
sight; waited still longer to give the drowsy night-boy
time to settle himself on his stool and go to
sleep. Then he went swiftly to the door of the
private room and unlocked it.</p>

<p>Gryson was ready, and even in the dim light of
the corridor Blount could see that he was white-faced
and trembling. In the silent faring to the
stair which wound down in a spiral around the
freight elevator Blount gripped the arm of trembling.</p>

<p>"You've got to get your nerve," he gritted savagely,
"or you'll be nipped before you've gone a
block!" And then: "Here's the stair: follow it
down until you get to the basement. There's a coal
entrance from the alley, and the engineer will be
with his boilers in the other wing&#8212;and probably
asleep. You've got it straight, have you? You're
to bring the papers to my office on or before Saturday
night. I'll be looking out for you, and if you
bring me the evidence, you'll be taken care of.
That's all. Down with you, now, and go quietly.
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a>If you're caught, I drop you like a hot nail;
remember that."</p>

<p>Still puffing at the cigar which glowed redly in the
darkness of the wing corridor, Blount waited until
his man had been given time to reach the basement.
Then he walked slowly back to the main corridor
and descended by the public stair without awakening
the elevator boy, who was sleeping soundly in his
car on the ground level.</p>

<p>On the short walk to the hotel the full significance
of the thing he had done had its innings. Cynical
criticism to the contrary notwithstanding, there is
now and then an honest lawyer who regards his oath
of admission to the bar&#8212;the oath which binds him
to uphold the cause of justice and fair dealing&#8212;as
something more than a mere form of words. Beyond
all question, an honest man who has sworn to uphold
the law may neither connive at crime nor shield
a criminal. Blount tried the shift of every man
who has ever stepped aside out of the plain path
of rectitude; he told himself morosely that he had
nothing to do with Gryson's past; that he had taken
no retainer from the Montana authorities; that the
criminal was merely a cog in a wheel which was
grinding toward a righteous end, and as such should
be permitted to serve his turn.</p>

<p>The well-worn argument is always specious to the
beginner, and Blount thought he had sufficiently
justified himself by the time he was pushing through
the revolving doors into the Inter-Mountain lobby.
But when he saw his father quietly smoking his bed-time
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>cigar in one of the big leather-covered lounging-chairs,
he realized that the first step had been taken
in an exceedingly thorny path; that whatever else
might be the outcome of the bargain with Thomas
Gryson, a son was coldly plotting to bring disgrace
and humiliation upon a father.</p>

<p>For this reason, and because, when all is said,
blood is much thicker than water, Blount made as
if he did not see the beckoning hand-wave from the
depths of the big chair in the smokers' alcove;
ignored it, and with set lips and burning eyes made
for the nearest elevator to take refuge in his room.</p>

<h3>A CRY IN THE NIGHT.</h3>


<p>With the critical election, a struggle which was to
decide for another two-year period whether or not
the people of the Sage-Brush State were to be the
masters or the servants of chartered monopoly, only
four days distant, the capital city took on the
aspect of a stirring camp&#8212;two rival camps, in fact,
since the State headquarters of the two chief parties
were in the Inter-Mountain Hotel&#8212;and each<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a>
incoming train brought fresh relays of henchmen
and district spellbinders to swell the sidewalk throngs
and to crowd the lobbies.</p>

<p>On the Friday morning Blount awoke with the
feeling that he had definitely cut himself off from
all the commonplace activities of the campaign.
There were two days of suspense to be outworn,
and if he could have compassed it he would have
been glad to efface himself completely. Since that
was impossible, and since it seemed equally impossible
that he should go on keeping up the farce of
the <i>modus vivendi</i> after he had taken the step which
would presently blazon his name to the world as
that of his father's accuser, he bought the morning
papers hurriedly at the hotel news-stand and went
down the avenue to get his breakfast at the railroad
restaurant, where he would be measurably sure of
isolation.</p>

<p>After giving his order he ran hastily through the
local news in the papers. There was no mention of
the arrest of one Thomas Gryson in any of the police
notes, and he breathed freer. But in <i>The Plainsman</i>
there was an editorial which was vaguely disturbing.
Blenkinsop, who wrote his own leaders,
hinted pointedly at coming disclosures which would
change the political map of the State for all time.
Blount, trying to determine how much or how little
the editorial was based upon his talk with the editor
on the Wednesday night, found his omelet tasteless.
Ready enough, as he was persuaded, to fire
the disrupting mine with his own hand, he was not
ready to surrender the match to any one else. Manifestly
he must see Blenkinsop and caution him.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, he walked, by the longest way
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>around, to his office in the Temple Court, hoping to
find work which would help him through the forenoon.
It was an idle hope. From a State-wide
shower of political correspondence the daily mail
had dropped suddenly to an inconsequential drizzle,
and there were no callers. Here, again, he saw, or
thought he saw, the all-powerful hand of the
machine. He had been used for a purpose, the purpose
of hoodwinking and deceiving the voters.
That purpose having been served, he was to be
dropped&#8212;was already dropped, as it seemed. By
noon the sheer time-killing effort became blankly
unbearable, and in desperation he broke with another
of the ideals&#8212;the one labelled sincerity&#8212;and
going boldly to the Inter-Mountain he waited in
the lobby for the family party of three to come
down to the one-o'clock luncheon in the public
<i>café</i>.</p>

<p>Joining the party when it came down, he found it
difficult only in the inner sanctuaries to maintain
the <i>status quo ante</i> Gryson. There was no shadow
of suspicion or coolness in his father's kindly smile
and genial greeting, and Mrs. Honoria rallied him
playfully upon the narrow margin by which he had
held his own and Patricia's places at the Gordon
dinner-table the night before. Only in Patricia's
eyes he read a curious questioning, a hint that
they were finding something in his eyes which was
<a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a>new and not wholly understandable. He knew well
enough what it was that she saw; and though she
was sitting opposite him at the table for four, he
looked at her as seldom as possible, devoting himself,
for once in a way, resolutely to his father's wife.</p>

<p>After luncheon he again fell back upon the dogged
boldness. Unable to contemplate a second plunge
into the solitude of the Temple Court offices, he
asked and was accorded permission to take Patricia
for a country drive in the little car. When the city
was left behind, and the small machine was purring
steadily northwestward over a road which led to
nowhere in particular, Blount put his finger accurately
upon the thing which had been building little
barriers of silence between them all the way out
from town.</p>

<p>"You knew me well enough yesterday to be reasonably
certain of what I would do in given circumstances,
didn't you, Patricia?" he began abruptly.
"To-day you are not so sure about it. Why?"</p>

<p>She laughed lightly, but there was a serious undernote
in her voic<a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a>e when she said: "There are moments
when you make me wonder if you haven't
been dabbling in necromancy, Evan. I was at that
very instant telling myself that it wasn't so."</p>

<p>"But you know it is so," he persisted. "Why am
I different?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Yet you recognize the fact?"</p>

<p>"Is it a fact?" she queried.</p>
<p><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a></p>
<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In what way are you different?"</p>

<p>"I am not altogether certain that I know, myself.
But I do know this: between yesterday and to-day
there is a gulf so wide that it seems measureless.
The scientists claim there are no cataclysms; no
sudden and sweeping changes taking place either in
the physical or the metaphysical field. If that be
true, the changes must go on subconsciously for a
long time before they are recognized. There is no
other way of accounting for the gulfs."</p>

<p>"You are talking miles over my head," she protested;
and, though the assertion was not strictly
true, it served its purpose.</p>

<p>"I can make it a little plainer," he went on, slowing
the motor until the small car was merely ambling.
"You remember that night at Wartrace
Hall, and what you told me? I went out from that
talk resolved to do what you had shown me I ought
to do, stubbornly refusing to consider the possibility
of failure. None the less, I have failed."</p>
<p><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a></p>
<p>"Oh, no!" she exclaimed; "not that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, just that. But the failure is not the worst
thing that has befallen me. I have lost or gained
something that pushes the yesterdays into a past
which can never be recovered. Let me tell you,
girl: I have been fighting in the open, against treachery
and deceit fighting always under cover. I have
been fighting bare-handed where others were armed.
Day by day I have been finding out the baseness
and the trickery; how my own side has used me as
a screen behind which the old dishonorable expedients
could be safely planned and carried out. I never
knew until within the past two days what all this
chicanery and double-dealing might be doing to me,
but now I do know."</p>

<p>"Will it bear telling?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"I think not&#8212;to you," he returned, matching her
low tone. "Let it be enough to say that I am no
longer the man I was when I came out here. Patricia,
I'm not fighting bare-handed any more; I'm
smashing in with any weapon I can get hold of.
There will be no such reform as the one you urged
me to champion&#8212;as the era of fair-dealing and sincerity
which I have been trying honestly and earnestly
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a>to inaugurate. Nevertheless, if my hand
doesn't tremble too much at the critical moment,
there will be, on the morning of next Tuesday, such
a revolution as this commonwealth has never seen.
Though they have robbed me and made a puppet
of me, I can still bring it about."</p>

<p>He had gone farther than he meant to, and he
thought she would protest. He knew that her convictions
of what should be and what should not be
were clear-cut and definite. But a man, even though
he be a lover, may know a woman's mind without
knowing very much about the woman herself.
There was no protest forthcoming. Quite the contrary,
she answered him with a little shudder that
was almost a caress, saying: "I think you have
grown&#8212;bigger and stronger than I ever thought
you could grow, Evan; and I'm sure your hand
won't tremble. Is that what you want me to say?"</p>

<p>Since there is no more contradictory being in a
sentient world than a man in love, Blount was not
quite sure that it was what he wanted her to say.
By times, to any lover worthy of the name, the
chosen woman figures as a goddess, a tutelary divinity
postulating for a mere earthly man all that is
high and holy and inerrant; an impeccable standard
by which he can measure his own baser desires and
ambitions and be shrived of them. At other times
the straitly human has its inn<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a>ings, and the longing
is for a comrade, a companion, a second self buried,
lost, submerged in the loyalty which never questions.
Having come slowly to maturity as a lover,
Blount had been leaning toward the divinity definition
of Patricia Anners. But now the iconoclastic
change was breaking many images.</p>

<p>"You are willing to believe that I haven't gone
altogether backward?" he queried, after the little
car had measured an additional stretch of the mesa
road.</p>

<p>"You are bigger and stronger," she repeated.</p>

<p>"How do you know I am?"</p>

<p>"I can tell; any woman could tell."</p>

<p>"Is the acquirement of size and strength so great
a thing that&#8212;"</p>

<p>"I think it is&#8212;in a woman's eyes," she admitted
fearlessly. "We are all more or less primitive and&#8212;and,
well, 'Stone-Agey,' let us say, in the last
analysis; at least, women are." And then: "You
don't know women very well, Evan."</p>

<p>"Don't I?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a>"No, you don't. You judge us by standards
which have no existence outside of your own purely
masculine deductions. For example: I suppose you
wouldn't admit for a moment that a good woman
might properly do things which would be entirely
discreditable in a man?"</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly and said: "Yesterday,
or the day before, I might have said 'no,' with all
the cocksureness of a boy of twenty. To-day I can
only say: 'Who am I, that I should judge any man&#8212;or
any woman?'" Then suddenly: "You are
making excuses for my father's wife. You needn't,
you know. She has fought me from the beginning,
and I know it. Sometimes I think that she is solely
responsible for my failure to accomplish the thing
I had set my heart upon. Let it go; I don't bear
malice. Just now I'm more interested in what you
were saying about the sex differences and the woman's
point of view. Have you been calling me a
weak man, Patricia?"</p>

<p>"No; only&#8212;a little&#8212;conventional," she returned
half reluctantly.</p>

<p>"But you are the quintessence of conventionality
yourself!" he burst out.</p>

<p>"Am I? Perhaps that was a passing phase, too.
Quite probably the little things will remain&#8212;the
dressing for dinner and the paying of party c<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>alls
and all that. But one really big man has made
many things seem petty and trifling&#8212;things that I
used to think were of the greatest possible importance."</p>

<p>"My father, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If I should ever marry, Evan, I should
be deliriously happy if I could find a man who
promised to grow to the stature of your father."</p>

<p>There was manifestly no rejoinder to be made to
this by David Blount's son, though it pointed to
another and still more painful involvement. What
would Patricia say when the <i>débâcle</i> came? Would
she lose faith in his father, and in all masculinity,
in the crash? Or would she borrow yet again from
the primitive woman she had been half-acknowledging
and still be loyal? In either case Blount saw
his own finish, and he was rather relieved when she
left the sex argument indeterminate and began to
talk of other things: of her father's decision to go
home at the end of the following week, of the good
times she had been having, and of the regret with
which she would turn her back upon the wide horizons
and the freedom of it all.</p>

<p>"I brought my shell with me when I came," she
confessed, laughing, "but I think it is broken into
little pieces by now. You will know how small the
pieces ar<a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a>e when I tell you that 'Tennessee Jim,'
your father's horse wrangler, calls me 'Miz' Pat,' and
it always makes me want to shake hands with him."</p>

<p>Blount made the afternoon last as he could, sending
the little car over many miles of the mesa roads
and encouraging the small confidences which were
enabling him to postpone his own evil hour. When
the sun was dipping toward the Carnadine Hills
they returned over a trail which came into the main
Quaretaro road at a point where the northern highway
begins its descent to the lower mesa level.
Half-way down the descending gulch they came to
the mouth of a small lateral canyon breaking into
the larger gorge from the eastward; a canyon dry
for the greater part of the year, but in the rainy
season affording an outlet for the flood-waters of
the Little Shonoho.</p>

<p>"That is a road I have always wanted to explore,"
said Patricia, pointing to the fine driveway leading
up the small canyon. "That is one of my weaknesses
when I am driving; I am never able to pass
a branch road without wanting to turn aside and
explore it."</p>

<p>"Then we'll explore this one, right now," said
Blount, cutting the car to the left. He was mor<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a>e
than willing to delay, even by littles, the moment
when he should be obliged to resume the sorry business
of waiting and dissembling.</p>

<p>Miss Anners glanced at the tiny watch pinned
upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Shall we have time? It's getting late."</p>

<p>"Plenty of time for all we shall be able to do or
see up here," Blount returned. "The road ends at
the canyon head, a mile above. There is a very
small and very exclusive summer-resort hotel, called
the Shonoho Inn, on the upper level. It has a six-weeks'
season&#8212;like the Florida resorts&#8212;they tell me,
and it is closed now."</p>

<p>It was within the next five hundred yards that
the prediction that there would be nothing to see
anticipated its fulfilment. At a sudden turn in the
narrow defile they came to a brush-built barricade
posted with a sign:</p>

<p><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>ROAD WASHED OUT ABOVE<br />
NO PASSING FOR VEHICLES!</p></div>

<p>"That settles it," said Blount shortly, and he
turned the car and let it roll back down the grade
to the main gulch.</p>

<p>When they were once more speeding toward town
Blount stole a glance at his companion, wondering
if it were the small disappointment which made her
silent.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she rejoined, brightening again. "I
have enjoyed every minute of it. I was just thinking
of what I said a little while ago; of how it is
going to break my heart to leave it all."</p>

<p>It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her that she
needn't leave it. But he remembered and caught
himself sharply. When the dreadful Tuesday should
have come and gone, she might be only too willing
to go away; and, in any event, he would have to
go. There would be no place in his own and his
father's State for him after Gryson returned, and
the match had been touched to the hidden mine of
high explosives. This was what wa<a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a>s in his mind
when he said rather tamely: "I suppose you will
have to go. There isn't any chance for social-settlement
work out here yet."</p>

<p>"No," she responded half-absently; and thereupon
he gave the little car still more spark and
throttle and sent it flying over the final stretch of
the fine road to the city.</p>

<p>The electric lights were showing like faint yellow
stars against the sunset sky when Blount skilfully
placed the small car at the Inter-Mountain curb
and lifted his companion to the sidewalk</p>

<p>"Are you going anywhere to-night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," was the reply. "There is a
'crush' on at the Weatherfords', but I don't know
whether Mrs. Blount has accepted for us or not."</p>

<p>"Don't go," he pleaded quickly. "Back out of
it some way, and give me just this one evening to
myself. Won't you do that, Patricia?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," she agreed. "But if Mrs. Blount has
accepted&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Confound Mrs. Blount!" he growled. And then<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>
the newly aroused underman in him added: "You
tell her that I want you to give me the evening, and
let that settle it."</p>

<p>As it turned out a little later, Miss Anners found
it unnecessary to be rude to her hostess. For some
reason best known to herself, Mrs. Honoria had declined
the invitation&#8212;engraved in the correctest
shaded Old English and made to include the senator
and Miss Anners&#8212;and was planning a free evening
for herself and her guest.</p>

<p>After the <i>café</i> dinner&#8212;a dinner at which Evan
Blount, once more calling himself all the hard names
in the hypocrite's vocabulary, made the fourth&#8212;Mrs.
Honoria proposed an adjournment to the hotel
parlors, which were in the mezzanine lounge. Later,
she found herself alone on the divan which had been
drawn up to command a view of the spirited scene
in the lobby below. The senator had gone down
to mingle with the politicians, and she could see
him&#8212;big, masterful, and smiling&#8212;moving about
from group to group. On the opposite side of the
mezzanine gallery, Evan and Patricia were "doing
time," as the little lady musingly phrased it: walking
up and down and talking quietly; a handsome
couple, as the approving glances of more than one
passing guest testified.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Honoria, thus isolated, came at the appointed
time the sober-eyed young traffic manager
<a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>for the railroad company. Gantry had been under
orders from the little lady for the better part of
the afternoon, but the business of the day had
given him no chance to report earlier.</p>

<p>"You got my note?" he asked, taking the place
she made for him on the tête-à-tête divan.</p>

<p>"Yes; a little while before dinner. It came just
in time to let me send frightfully late 'regrets' to
Mrs. Weatherford."</p>

<p>"I couldn't come sooner. I've had the Hathaway
crowd on my hands all afternoon. There is something
in the wind, and those fellows are scared stiff.
They say that Evan's speech-making has stirred up
the working men and the rank and file like a declaration
of war with Mexico, and nobody can tell what
is going to happen next Tuesday."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"No, not quite all. There is a mild panic on in
at least three of the city wards over the disappearance
of a fellow named Gryson, a sort of&#8212;er&#8212;wire-puller
and all-around general-utility man. Some
say he has been doing crooked work and had to disappear;
others say that he has taken his pay for
whatever job he was doing and has skippe<a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a>d out,
leaving his journeymen strikers to hold the bag."</p>

<p>"Gryson," said the little lady, her eyes narrowing;
"Gryson&#8212;the name is curiously familiar. He
is what you call a ward-worker, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Gantry nodded. "Something of the sort, yes.
Evan calls him one of the 'pie-eaters,' and away
along early in the game they had a set-to in Evan's
office and Evan fired him; told him if he ever came
back he'd throw him out."</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Honoria's fine eyes became reflective.</p>

<p>"Richard," she said softly, "I'd give anything
in the world if I could know that Evan still feels
that way about Thomas Gryson."</p>

<p>"Then you know the plug-ugly, do you?" said
Gantry.</p>

<p>"I know of him. He is a criminal and a dangerous
man."</p>

<p>"Well, he is out of it, I guess; he must be, if his
own running-mates can't find him."</p>

<p>"Isn't Mr. Kittredge trying to find him, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I think Kittredge played it <a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a>rather
low down on the poor beggar. They had a deal of
some sort, and when Gryson put his price on the
job&#8212;"</p>

<p>"I know," she interrupted. "Mr. Kittredge ought
to have paid him and let him go."</p>

<p>Gantry's smile was a tribute to superior genius.</p>

<p>"You've got me going," he said; "you always
have me going. With the election only three days
off, I can't tell yet what you and the senator are
trying to do."</p>

<p>"The senator, at least, has never made any secret
of his object," she smiled back at him. "He
has told everybody that he is out for a clean sweep."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Gantry; "but no man living
knows what he means by a 'clean sweep.' I'll bet
there are a hundred men down there in the lobby
right now who would give the best year out of their
lives to know. And they can't guess&#8212;they can't
begin to guess!"</p>

<p>"Let us leave them to their gu<a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a>esses, while we go
back to the certainties," she suggested. "Did you
find out what I asked you to?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I don't know whether I ought to tell
you or not. I'm still drawing my salary from the
railroad, you know."</p>

<p>"And you are not sure that I am drawing mine?"
she laughed. "Don't you remember when Mr. McVickar
gave me this?" touching the little jewel-incrusted
watch on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember; also I remember that this
is the first time I have ever seen you wearing it."
And then: "I'd never try to bribe you in the wide,
wide world, Mrs. Blount."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"For two reasons: you are too much in love with
your husband; and, if you took a notion to fly the
track, a king's ransom wouldn't be big enough to
make you stay bribed."</p>

<p>"I am flattered, I'm sure; but I'm still in the
dark about the thing you have come here to tell
me," she reminded him.</p><p><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a></p>

<p>"I presume you may as well know it, though I
can tell you that it has been kept the darkest kind
of a secret. Mr. McVickar came west to-day from
Bald Butte in a new gasolene unit-car which is supposed
to be making a trial trip over the road. The
car is supposed to have a bunch of the Chicago officials
on board, though not half a dozen men on this
division know that the vice-president is the only
official, and that the others are clerks and telegraphers."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the small person quickly.</p>

<p>"That gasolene special is lost. No station west
of Bald Butte has yet reported it. Strictly between
us two, it left the main line at the old disused track
leading out to the abandoned Shoshone mine workings.
There were autos to meet it at the mine, and
by this time Mr. McVickar is probably toasting his
feet before an open wood-fire in the Shonoho Inn."</p>

<p>Mrs. Honoria leaned her two round arms on the
mezzanine rail, and looked long and earnestly down
upon the caucussing lobby throng. When she looked
up it was to say: "There are wires?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a>"A full set of cut-ins. You can trust the big
boss for that. He is in touch with every corner
of the State, just the same as he would be if he
were here in his usual election headquarters in the
hotel."</p>

<p>The small plotter became silent again, and when
she spoke she was smiling brightly.</p>

<p>"You are a good boy, Richard, and you shall
<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a>have your reward. And it is going to be something
that will make you happy, this time. Run away,
now, and let me have a little solitude. I want to
think."</p>

<p>It was a full hour after Gantry's disappearance
that the senator came up-stairs, and Mrs. Honoria
beckoned to the pair on the opposite side of the
gallery.</p>

<p>"It's bedtime," she said, when they came around
to her divan. And then, with a malicious little
grimace for Evan: "I've been counting, and I've
seen Patricia stifle three distinct and separate
yawns in the last five minutes. She has been up
every night since we came to town, and&#8212;"</p>

<p>Left to himself, Blount sat watching the crowd
for a time, and then went to his room to read himself
to sleep. One of the two crucial days of suspense
was outworn, but there was another coming;
and after he had read for an hour he went to bed,
resolutely determined to get the rest necessary to
carry him through the dreaded Saturday. Sleep
came quickl<a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a>y when he had turned off the lights, but
it was merely a transition to a troubled dreamland
in which Patricia, Mrs. Honoria, Gryson, and Gantry
were weirdly confused. In the thick of it he
seemed to see the ward-heeler standing at his bedside
and beating furiously upon a huge Chinese
gong. When he sprang up and began to rub his
eyes, the room was lighted by a red glare, and the
dream-noise was translated into the rattling of wheels
and the clanging of alarm-gongs and cries of "Fire!"
in the avenue below.</p>

<p>As a city dweller, Blount should have felt the
wall of the room, and, finding it still cool, should
have turned over and gone to sleep again. Instead,
he slipped out of bed and went to the window. One
glance showed him that the fire was in the business
district, either in or near the Temple Court
Building. That was enough to make him dress hurriedly
and hasten to the street, where he found a
handful of policemen trying ineffectually to keep a
clear pavement for the racing fire-trucks. Watching
his chance, Blount darted out to make the crossing.
He was half-way to the opposite curb when an
unwieldy hook-and-ladder truck, drawn by a pair
of magnificent grays, came lurching and plunging
down the side street upon which the hotel cornered.</p>

<p>In front of the horses, and leaping and barking
at their heads in a frenzy of excitement, was a spotted
coach-dog&#8212;the truck squad's mascot. Blount was
within a few feet of the farther sidewalk, and was
well out of danger when the long truck slewed into
<a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a>the avenue. But at the passing instant the mascot
dog, leaping and whirling like a four-footed dervish,
sprang backward. Blount felt the catapulting shock
of a yielding body between his shoulders, heard a
yell from the truck-driver on his high seat, and went
plunging headlong to the curb. After which he felt
and heard no more.</p>

<h3>FIELD HEADQUARTERS</h3>


<p>In the great world-battles of yesterday, or the
day before, the commanding general rode, with a
few chosen officers of his staff, to some near-by hill-top,
shell-swept and perilous, and with the help of
a pair of field-glasses and a corps of hard-riding
aides kept in touch as he could with the shifting
fortunes of his divisions and brigades. It would be
small credit to an up-to-date day of progress <a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a>and
invention if this were not all changed. The present-moment
commander-in-chief&#8212;warring, industrial,
or political&#8212;may sit, thanks to the Morses and the
Edisons, comfortably in office-coat and slippers, far
removed from the battle turmoil, directing his forces
with the pressure of a finger upon the appropriate
electric button, or in a few words dictated to the
human ear of a clicking telegraph-instrument.</p>

<p>By all these adventitious aids Vice-President McVickar
was profiting on the Saturday morning following
the mysterious disappearance on the Friday
of the gasolene unit-car somewhere between Bald
Butte and the capital. The small resort hotel at
the head of Shonoho Canyon had been transformed
into a field headquarters. The hotel manager's
desk, wheeled out in front of a crackling wood-fire
in the ornate little lobby, was studded with its row
of electric call-buttons; a railroad dining-car crew
had taken possession of the kitchen; and the spacious
writing-and lounging-room, sacred, in the season,
to the guests of the exclusive hotel, housed a
ranking of glass-topped telegraph-tables and impromptu
desks&#8212;a work-room manned by a dozen
picked young men, with O'Brien, the vice-president's
private secretary, acting as the chief.</p>

<p>Though the momentous Tuesday was still three
<a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a>days in the future, Mr. McVickar was actively at
work on the Saturday morning, gathering in the
loose ends and strengthening the railroad company's
defences. With his arm-chair drawn up to the borrowed
desk he was running rapidly through the telegrams
filtering in a steady shower from the crackling
sounders in the writing-room. When the situation
had begun to outline itself with something like coherence,
he pressed a call-button for O'Brien.</p>

<p>"How about that wire to Detwiler at Ophir&#8212;any
reply yet?" was the rasping demand shot at
the secretary.</p>

<p>"Nothing yet; no, sir."</p>

<p>"Go after him again! There's a screw loose
among those miners! How about Hathaway?
Did you phone Twin Buttes?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and Grogan, the mill time-keeper, answered.
He says Mr. Hathaway is in the capital
and something has gone wrong&#8212;he doesn't know
what."</p>

<p>"Keep the wires hot until you can get hold of
Hathaway himself, and when you nail him, switch
him over to my phone. Any word from the irrigation
people at Natcho?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They say that the farmers under the High
Line have been getting restive and forming associations.
Daniels was the man who talked to me, and
he says it's a Gordon movement, though the ranchmen
are trying to keep it quiet."</p>

<p>"Take a message to Daniels!" snapped the vice-president;
and then, dictating: "'How would it do
to let it be known quietly that Gordon's election
means raise in price of water to High Line users?'
Send that, and sign it 'Committee of Safety.' Now
how about Kittredge? Did you get him?"</p>

<p>"I did; he's driving out in his car, and he ought
to be here in a few minutes."</p>

<p>As if to make O'Brien's word good, the roar of an
automobile came from the driveway, dominating
for the moment the chattering of the telegraph-instruments,
and a little later Kittredge came in, lifting
his goggles and wiping the road dust from his
closely clipped black beard.</p>

<p>"That car of yours isn't what it might be, Kittredge,"
was the vice-president's crusty greeting.
"You'd better get a faster one. Sit down, and let's
have it. How are things shaping up in the city?"</p>

<p>The big superintendent sat down and found a
cigar in an inner pocket of his driving-coat.</p>

<p>"We are holding our own, as far as anybody can
see," he returned.</p>

<p>"That 'as far as anybody can see' is just your
weakness, Kittredge," said the chief testily. "What
we want&#8212;what we've got to have first, last, and all
the time&#8212;is the <i>fact</i>. Now see if you can answer
a few straight questions. What is the senator
doing?"</p>

<p>"His wife has a young girl visiting her, and if the
Honorable Dave is doing anything more than to
show the two women a good time, I can't find it out."</p>

<p>"There you go again! You say 'if.' It's your
business to know."</p>

<p>Kittredge held his peace. Being designed by nature
for a heavy-weight ring-fighter, there were times
when he felt like taking off his coat to the vice-president.</p>

<p>"Well?" prompted McVickar, when Kittredge
remained obstinately silent.</p>

<p>"If I knew what sort of a deal you have made
with the senator&#8212;"</p>

<p>"That cuts no figure. But let it go. What's
young Blount doing?"</p>

<p>"He's out of it, good and plenty. He started to
go to the Sampson Block fire last night and was
knocked down by a hook-and-ladder truck. It's
a cracked skull, and Doc Dillon says he's safe to
stay in bed for a week or so."</p>

<p>"H'm," said the chief reflectively. "That is almost
what you might call opportune, Kittredge.
The young fellow has done his work well, but there
was always the danger that he might overdo it.
In fact, there was a time, a week or two ago, when
I thought he would have to be called down and
given a lesson. Now then, how about that Gryson
business?"</p>

<p>"It was just as you said: I had to take Tom by
the neck and get rid of him."</p>

<p>"He did his work all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and came swaggering around for his pay.
I sized it up one side and down the other. He had
a pretty bad case of swelled head and tried to hold
me up for a bonus, hinting around about what he
could do if he wanted to throw the gaff into us. As
I say, I sized it up, and took snap judgment on him&#8212;pulled
the Montana racket and gave him twenty-four
hours' start of the police."</p>

<p>The vice-president frowned and shook his head.
"You took a chance&#8212;a long chance, Kittredge!
Twenty-four hours gave him all the time he needed
to fall afoul of young Blount."</p>

<p>The big superintendent grinned amiably.</p>

<p>"The senator helped out on that," he explained.</p>

<p>"The senator? How was that?"</p>

<p>"It's the first time he has shown any part of his
hand to me in the entire campaign. About an hour
after I had shot Tom Gryson to pieces a note came
down from the Inter-Mountain, asking me to come
up. I didn't get to see the senator himself, but
Mrs. Blount gave me the dope. As a result, young
Blount got a hurry telegram from you, directing
him to go to Lewiston at once in that right-of-way
matter of Brodhead's. I gave him my car, and the
trip cost him the better part of two whole days."</p>

<p>Again the vice-president shook his head.</p>

<p>"Your methods are always pretty crude, Kittredge,"
he commented. "You took another long
chance when you forged my name to a telegram
for as shrewd a young lawyer as Evan Blount. But
go on. You got Blount out of the way&#8212;then what?"</p>

<p>"Then I went after Gryson again. The little
woman's hint hit the bull's-eye as true as a rifle bullet.
Tom meant to give us away to Blount. He
haunted Blount's up-town office the better part of
the day; and finally, in sheer self-defence, I had
to tip him off to the police, as I had threatened
to. Another little mystery bobbed up there. Chief
Robertson winked one eye at me and said: 'You're
too late, Mr. Kittredge; your man has already been
piped off and he's gone.'"</p>

<p>"Who did it?" snapped McVickar.</p>

<p>"I don't know, and Robertson wouldn't tell me.
But I got him to promise to put out the reward
quietly. If Gryson comes back he'll be nipped before
he can talk."</p>

<p>"With young Blount laid up, it won't make much
difference," was the summing-up rejoinder. And
then: "I think that is all&#8212;for this morning. Go
around to the telephone-exchange when you get
back to town and tell the manager that I want a
special operator&#8212;a man, if he's got one&#8212;put on
this long-distance wire. Have you sent your linemen
out to guard the wires on the Shoshone mine
track?"</p>

<p>"Yes; all the way from the switch to the hills."</p>

<p>"All right; that's all. Keep your finger on the
pulse of things in town to-day, and arrange with
your despatcher to give my operators here a clear
wire in any direction whenever it's called for. Above
all, keep me posted, Kittredge; don't let anything
get by you, no matter how trivial it may seem."</p>

<p>As the superintendent was climbing into his car,
the railroad electrician who was in charge of the
men guarding the telegraph-wires came up.</p>

<p>"One minute, Mr. Kittredge. I've put the box
in, according to orders&#8212;"</p>

<p>"What box, and whose orders?"</p>

<p>"The recording microphone in Mr. McVickar's
office, in there; and by his orders, I guess&#8212;at least
they came from one of his men. We're needing a
couple more batteries, and I was just wondering if
it'd be all right to take 'em from that gasolene
unit-car. We could put 'em back afterwards."</p>

<p>"Yes; take 'em wherever you can find 'em," said
the superintendent, who was thinking pointedly of
other things just then; and the permission given,
he started his motor and drove away.</p>

<h3>BLOOD AND IRON</h3>


<p>Ten o'clock in the Saturday forenoon marked the
time of Superintendent Kittredge's flying visit to
his chief's headquarters-on-the-field at the head of
Shonoho Canyon; and at that hour Evan Blount,
blinking dizzily, and with his head bandaged and
throbbing as if the premier company of all the African
tom-tom symphonists were making free with it,
was letting Mrs. Honoria beat up his pillows and
prop him with them, so that the drum-beating clamor
might be minimized to some bearable degree.</p>

<p>"You are feeling better now?" suggested the volunteer
nurse, going to adjust the window-curtains
for the better comfort of the blinking and aching
eyes.</p>

<p>The victim of the hook-and-ladder squad's mascot
answered qualitatively.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had been having an argument with
a battering-ram and had come off second-best. I've
been out of my head, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"A little, yes; but that was to be expected. You
were pretty badly hurt."</p>

<p>"Have I been talking?"</p>

<p>"Not very much&#8212;nothing intelligible." The little
lady had drawn her chair to the window and was
busying herself with the never-finished embroidery.</p>

<p>"What hit me&#8212;was it the truck?"</p>

<p>"No; some of the people in the street said it was
a dog; a coach-dog running and jumping at the
heads of the fire-horses. In falling you struck your
head against the iron grating of a sewer inlet."</p>

<p>"Umph!" said Blount, and the face-wrinkling
which was meant to be a sardonic smile turned itself
into a painful grin. "Shot to death by a dog!
Blenkinsop or some of the others ought to have run
that for a head-line." Then, with a twist of the hot
eyeballs: "This isn't my room. Where am I?"</p>

<p>"You are in the spare room of our suite. Your
father had you brought here so that we could take
care of you properly. But you mustn't talk too
much; it's the doctor's orders."</p>

<p>Blount lay for a long time watching her as she
passed the needle in and out through the bit of
snowy linen stretched upon the tiny embroidery-ring.
She had fine eyes, he admitted; eyes with the
little downward curve in brow and lid at the outer
corners&#8212;the curve of allurement, he had heard it
called. Also, her hands were shapely and pretty.
He recalled the saying that a woman may keep her
age out of her face, but her hands will betray her.
Mrs. Honoria's hands were still young; they looked
almost as young as Patricia's, he decided. At the
comparison he broke over the rule of silence.</p>

<p>"Does Patricia know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. She has been here nearly all morning. She
wouldn't let anybody else hold your head while the
doctor was sewing it up."</p>

<p>"I know," he returned; "that is a part of her&#8212;of
her special training: first aid to the injured, and
all that. They teach it in the German sociological
schools she attended last year."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I see"&#8212;with a malicious little smile
to accentuate the curving downdroop of the pretty
eyelids. "You mean that she was just getting a
bit of practice. I wondered why she was so willing;
most young women are so silly about the sight
of a little blood. Don't you think you'd better try
to sleep for a while? Doctor Dillon said it would
be good for you if you could."</p>

<p>"Heavens and earth!" he chanted impatiently;
"I'm not sick!" And then, with a sharp fear stabbing
him: "What day is this, please?"</p>

<p>She looked up with a smile. "Are you wondering if
you have lost a day? You haven't. The fire was at
three o'clock this morning, and this is Saturday."</p>

<p>As if the naming of the day had been a spell to
strike him dumb, Blount shut his eyes and groped
helplessly for some hand-hold upon the suddenly rehabilitated
responsibilities. Saturday&#8212;the day when
Gryson would return with the proofs which, if they
were to serve any good end, must be given the widest
possible publicity in the two days remaining before
the election. Blount recalled his carefully laid plans:
he had intended giving Collins and the two record
clerks a half-holiday, so that Gryson might come
and go unnoticed. Also, he had meant to make a
definite appointment with Blenkinsop and the representative
of the United Press, to the end that there
might be no delay in the firing of the mine. Lastly,
Gryson must be shielded and gotten out of the city
in safety; so much the traitor had a right to demand if he
should risk his liberty and his life by
returning with the evidence.</p>

<p>It was a hideous tangle to owe itself to the joyous
gambollings of the firemen's mascot dog. And
there was more to it than the hopeless smashing of
the Saturday's plans. Into the midst of the mordant
reflections, and adding a sting which was all
its own, came the thought of this newest obligation
laid upon him by his father and his father's wife.
They had taken him in and were loading him down
with kinsman gifts of care and loving-kindness, while
his purpose had been&#8212;must still be&#8212;to strike back
like a merciless enemy. He remembered the old
fable of the adder warmed to life in a man's bosom,
and it left him sick and nerveless.</p>

<p>None the less, the obsession of the indomitable
purpose persisted, gripping him like the compelling
hand of a giant in whose grasp he was powerless.
For a time he sought to escape, not realizing that
the obsession was the call of the blood passed on
from the men of his race who, with axe and rifle,
had hewn and fought their way in the primeval wilderness,
and would not be denied. Neither did he
suspect that the dominating passion driving him on
was his best gift from the man against whom he was
pitting his strength. What he did presently realize
was that the giant grip of purpose was not to be
broken; and thereupon a vast cunning came to possess
him. He must have time and a chance to plan
again: if he should feign sleep, perhaps the woman
whose presence and personality were shackling the
inventive thought would go away and leave him
free to think.</p>

<p>She did go after a while, though so noiselessly
that when he opened his eyes it was with the fear
that he should see her still bending over the little
embroidery frame at the window. Finding himself
alone, he sat up in bed and gave the broken head an
opportunity to blot him out if it could. For a little
space the walls of the room became as the interior
of a hollow peg-top, spinning furiously with a noise
like the rushing of many waters. After the surroundings
had resumed their normal figurings he
rose to his knees. There was another grapple with
the whirling peg-top, and again he mastered the
dizzying confusion. Made bold by success, he got
his feet on the floor and stood up, clinging to the
brass foot-rail of the bed until the unstable encompassments
had once more come to rest.</p>

<p>By this time he was able to conquer all save the
throbbing headache. Shuffling first to one door
and then to the other, he shot the bolts against intrusion.
Then he staggered across to the dressing-case
and took a look at himself in the glass. The
bandaged head, with its haggard, pain-distorted face
grimacing back at him, extorted a grunt of sardonic
disapproval, but the mirror answered the query
which had sent him stumbling across to it. The
bandage was comparatively small and tightly drawn;
a soft hat could be worn over it&#8212;the hat would cover
and decently hide it.</p>

<p>Next he found his clothes, those he had been
wearing at the time of the accident. Somebody had
been thoughtful enough to have them cleaned and
pressed; from which he argued that the plunging
fall on the wet asphalt had been demoralizing in
more ways than one. Continuing the experimental
venture, he walked back and forth and up and down
until he could do it without clutching at the bed-rails
to save himself from falling. Then he reshot
the door-bolts and went back to bed to await developments.</p>

<p>The first of these came when Patricia brought his
luncheon. He had been wondering if she would be
the one to come; wondering and hoping. With the
unfilial purpose driving him on, there were added
twinges at the thought of his father's wife going on
piling the mountain of obligation higher and still
higher by waiting upon him, and thus reminding
him at every turn of the adder fable. With Patricia
it was different.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he grimaced, when Patricia
came in with the daintily appointed server. "Getting
a bit more of the first-aid practice, are you?"</p>

<p>"I am obeying orders," she flashed back, when
she had shaken up the pillows and placed the appetizing
meal within his reach. "Mrs. Blount said
I'd probably have a less disturbing influence upon
you than she would. Shall I feed you?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, no! I'm not that near dead, I
hope! If you don't believe it, you may sit down and
watch me eat&#8212;if you're not missing your own luncheon."</p>

<p>"Nurses have no regular meal-times," she retorted.
And then: "You are feeling a great deal
better, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Much better&#8212;since you came. Did they tell
you it was a dog?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and he went on.</p>

<p>"It was my unlucky night, I guess. Did the fire
burn up my office? I forgot to ask Mrs. Blount
about that."</p>

<p>"No; it was a building across the street from the
Temple Court."</p>

<p>"'Small favors thankfully received,'" he quoted,
resolutely pushing a fresh recurrence of the tomtom
beatings into the background; "small favors
and larger ones in proportion&#8212;this broth, for example.
It's simply delicious. I hadn't realized how
hungry I was."</p>

<p>"The broth ought to be good; I made it myself,
you know."</p>

<p>"You did? Where, for pity's sake?"</p>

<p>"In the hotel kitchen. The <i>chef</i> was furious
at first. He twirled his Napoleon-III mustaches
and sputtered and swelled up like an angry old
turkey. But when I talked nice to him in his
own beloved Bordelaise he let me do anything I
pleased."</p>

<p>Blount looked up quickly, and the movement
brought the head-throbbings back with disconcerting
celerity.</p>

<p>"You are cruelly kind to me, Patricia; everybody
is kind to me. And I'm not needing kindness just
now," he ended.</p>

<p>"Aren't you? I don't agree with you, and I'm
sure your father and Mrs. Blount wouldn't." Then
she went on to tell him how they had all been up,
watching the progress of the fire from their windows,
when the word came that he had been hurt in the
street. Also, she told how his father had impatiently
smashed the telephone because, the wires having
been cut and tangled in the fire, he could get no response,
and how, thereupon, he had turned the entire
night force of the hotel out to go in search of a
doctor. "But with all that, he couldn't stand it to
look on while the doctor was taking the stitches,"
she added. "He turned his back and tramped over
here to the window; and I could hear him gritting
his teeth and&#8212;and swearing."</p>

<p>If Evan Blount ate faster than a sick man should,
it was because there are limits to the finest fortitude.
Patricia ran on cheerfully, minimizing her
own part in the first-aid incidents, and magnifying
the anxious and affectionate concern of the senator
and his wife. He listened because he could not
help it; but when he had finished, and she was
inquiring if there was anything else she could do
for him, he dissembled, saying that he would try
to sleep, and asking her to shut out more of the
daylight and to deny him to everybody until evening.</p>

<p>She promised; but naturally enough, with the
dreadful responsibility drawing nearer with every
hour-striking of the tiny leather-cased travelling-clock
on the dresser, sleep was out of the question for him.
Hot-eyed and restless, he wore out the long afternoon
in feverish impatience, slipping now and then
into the shadow land of delirium when the pain was
severest, but clinging always to the obsessing idea.
At whatever cost, the crisis must find him resolute
to do his part. Gryson must be met, the evidence
of fraud must be secured, and the fraud itself must
be defeated.</p>

<p>The bright autumn day was fading to its twilight,
and the shadows were gathering around his bed,
when Patricia tiptoed in to ask, first, if he were
awake, and, next, what he would like to have for
his supper. Exhausted by the waiting battle, he
answered briefly: he was not hungry; if he could
be left alone again, with the assurance that no one
would come to disturb him, it was all he would ask.
He tried to say it crustily, with the irritable impatience
of the convalescent&#8212;dissembling again. But
the young woman with a self-sacrificial career in
view had lost none of her womanly gift of sympathetic
intuition.</p>

<p>"You are not so well this evening," she said softly,
laying a cool palm on his forehead. "I think I'd
better telephone Doctor Dillon."</p>

<p>Now the thing for Patricia's lover to do was obvious.
With pity thus trembling on the very crumbling
brink of love, the opportunity which months of
patient wooing had not evoked lay ready to his hand.
It was a fair measure of the mastery an obsession
may obtain&#8212;the lover's ability to thrust the gentler
emotion into the background, to feign restless irritation
under the passion-stirring touch, and to say:
"No; I don't want Dillon or anybody; I want to
be left alone. Please latch the door when you go
out, and tell father and his&#8212;and Mrs. Blount that
I don't want to be disturbed."</p>

<p>She took the curt dismissal in silence, and after
she was gone Blount sat up in bed and cursed himself
fervently and painstakingly for the little brutality.
But the remorseful cursings took nothing from
the grim determination which had prompted the
brutality. The dusk was thickening, and the street
electrics were turning the avenue into a broad highway
of radiance. Blount got up, and with a disheartening
renewal of the splitting headache, began
to dress, but there were many pauses in which he
had to sit on the edge of the bed to wait for the
throbbing pain to subside.</p>

<p>The next step was to reach his own room, two
floors above, and he let himself cautiously into the
corridor and locked the door from the outside.
Making a long round to avoid the elevators, he
dragged himself up two flights of stairs and so came
to his goal.</p>

<p>Enveloped in a rain-coat, and with a soft hat
drawn well over his eyes, he compassed the escape
from the upper floor by means of the remote stair
he had used in ascending, and so reached the
ground-floor. Fortunately, the lobby was crowded;
and turning up the collar of the rain-coat to hide
the bandage, Blount worked his way toward the
revolving doors. More than once in the dodging
progress he rubbed shoulders with men whom he
knew, and who knew him; but the shielding hat-brim
and the muffling rain-coat saved him.</p>

<p>Reaching the street, he did not attempt to walk
to the Temple Court. Instead, he crept around to
a garage near the hotel and hired a two-seated
road-car. Quite naturally, the garage-keeper wanted
to send his own driver, and Blount counted it as an
unavoidable misfortune that he was obliged to give
his name, and to hear the motor-liveryman say:
"Oh, sure! I didn't recognize you, Mr. Blount. I
reckon Senator Dave's son can have anything o'
mine that he wants."</p>

<p>Blount drove the road-car all the way around the
Capitol grounds to come into his office street inconspicuously.
Across from the Temple Court the fire
ruins were still smouldering, and there was an acrid
odor of stale smoke in the air. For a full third of
the block the street was littered with débris. Blount
stopped his machine at the nearest corner and got
out to reconnoitre the office-building entrance. In
the vestibule he glanced up at the face of the illuminated
wall-clock, making a hasty calculation based
upon the leaving time of the east-bound Overland.
There were fifty minutes to spare, and when he
reached his office, and had turned on the desk-light
and dropped heavily into his chair, he called
up the railroad station to inquire about the train.
The Overland was reported ten minutes late. If
Gryson should show up in time, this earliest outgoing
train must be made to serve as the means for
his flight.</p>

<p>Blount had scarcely formulated the condition when
the office-door winged noiselessly, and the man himself,
hollow-eyed and haggard, stumbled in. As once
before, Blount got up and went to shut the door
and lock it. When he came back, Gryson had taken
his seat in a chair at the desk-end, where the light
from the shaded working-lamp fell upon his sinister
face.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been all th' way t' hell and back ag'in,"
he announced in a grating whisper. "They've put
th' reward out, and three times since last night some
of me own pals 've tried to snitch on me." Then
he drew a carefully wrapped package from its hiding-place
under his coat and laid it on the desk. "It's
all there," he went on in the same rasping undertone.
"Some of 'em give up to get square wit' th'
bosses, and some of 'em had to have a gun shoved
in their faces. No matter; they've come across&#8212;the
last damn' wan of 'em; and th' affidavits are
there, too&#8212;when I c'd get next to a dub of a not'ry
that'd make 'em."</p>

<p>Blount did not untie the package, nor did he
cross-examine the traitor. His head was throbbing
again almost unbearably, and he was beginning to
fear that he might not last to carry out the plan of
safe-conduct for the informer. Slipping the precious
package into an inner pocket of the enveloping coat,
he took a compact roll of bank-bills from a drawer
in the desk and gave it to Gryson, saying tersely:
"That isn't a bribe, you understand; it's merely to
help you make your getaway. Can you manage
to ride on Transcontinental trains without being
recognized offhand?"</p>

<p>Gryson pulled a false beard from his pocket and
showed it. "Wit' that, and me old hat, I've been
keepin' most o' th' boys from tippin' me off," he
said.</p>

<p>"All right; here's the lay-out. You have earned
immunity, so far as this latest raid on you is concerned,
by turning State's evidence. But you've got
to move on, and keep moving. Do you get that?"</p>

<p>The fugitive nodded, and Blount got up to stagger
across to the office wardrobe, from which he took
the extra rain-coat kept there for emergencies.</p>

<p>"Here, get into this and go down-stairs. At the
corner above, you'll find a two-seated motor-car
backed against the curb. Do you know enough
about machinery to start an auto-engine?"</p>

<p>Gryson nodded again. "I'd ought to, seein' that
I've been a gang boss in a shop that made 'em."</p>

<p>"Good enough; crank the motor, climb in, and
wait. I'll do the rest."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Blount had stumbled out of
the elevator at the ground-floor and was groping
his way along the sidewalk toward the corner&#8212;groping
because the pain had become blinding again
and the street-lights were taking on many-colored
and fantastic brilliancies.</p>

<p>When he finally found the car, it was mainly by
the sense of hearing; the motor was drumming softly
under the hood, and there was a blur in the mechanician's
seat which answered for the crouching figure
of the ward-worker. By a supreme effort of will
Blount swung himself up behind the steering-wheel
and let the clutch in. Luckily, the street was clear
of vehicles and he made the turn in safety; but
fully realizing his handicap, he steered straight away
from the business district, and making a wide circuit
through the residence quarter, brought the
car out in the eastern suburb at the beginning of a
road paralleling the Transcontinental tracks.</p>

<p>With the lights of the city dropping away to the
rear, and the drumming motor quickened to racing
speed, he told the fugitive from justice what was to
be done and the manner of its doing. Twenty-two
miles out they would reach the coal-mine station of
Wardlaw, a few minutes ahead of the Overland.
Since all east-bound trains stopped at the coal-mines
to coal the engines, the way of escape would be open.</p>

<p>Something more than a wordless, space-devouring
half-hour beyond this, Blount applied the brakes
and dropped his passenger at the rear of the small
iron-roofed building which served as the railroad
station for the coal-mines. Far to the rear on the
twenty-two-mile tangent the headlight of the coming
train showed like a blazing star low on the western
horizon.</p>

<p>"Go and blacken your face and hands at one of
the slack dumps and pass yourself for a miner quitting
his job," was Blount's parting suggestion; but
the hollow-eyed fugitive had a last word to say, too,
and he said it.</p>

<p>"I've been t' hell and back, as I told you, and
'twas f'r on'y th' wan thing: give me your word,
Evan Blount, that you'll chop th' damn' tree down
and let it lie where it falls! That's all I'm askin',
this trip."</p>

<p>"You needn't lose any sleep worrying about that,"
was the curt reply; and without waiting for the
train arrival, Blount turned the car and sent it
racing on the way back to the city.</p>

<p>By all the tests he knew how to apply, he was
little better than a dead man when he returned the
hired auto to the side-street garage and made his
halting way around to the hotel. He had long
since given up the idea of trying to see Blenkinsop.
He knew that the editor would not be in his office
much before ten o'clock, and the two-hour wait was
not to be endured.</p>

<p>Clinging desperately to the single purpose of getting
back to the deserted room before his absence
should be discovered, and weighed down by a crushing
sense of the immorality of the step he had just
taken in bargaining with a hunted criminal and in
conniving at his escape, he pressed on, pushing
through the revolving doors and slipping once more
into the Saturday evening lobby throng. Edging
around to the stair, he took all the cautious steps in
reverse; ascending first to his own room to leave the
rain-coat and the hat, and afterward feeling his way
down the servants' stair and through the lower corridor
to the locked door in his father's private suite.</p>

<p>Past this he had a hazy notion that part of him&#8212;the
observing part&#8212;stood aside and looked on
while the other part slowly and painfully struggled
out of its clothes and into its pajamas. Also he
saw the other part, after it had carefully secreted
the wrapped package of papers under the mattress,
beat the pillows feebly and bury its head in them.
After that there was a great blank.</p>

<h3>APPLES OF GOLD</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding the pillow-muffled plunge
which was almost a lapse into the coma of utter
exhaustion, Evan Blount awoke early on the Sunday
morning, refreshed and measurably free from
pain. Since the sun was just beginning to gild the
lofty finial on the dome of the Capitol opposite, there
was no one stirring as yet in the adjoining rooms of
the suite, and the streets were silent save for the
chanting cries of the newsboys.</p>

<p>Slipping out of bed, Blount crossed to the window
and threw it open. It was good to be able to stand
and walk without wincing; and a breath of the sunrise
breeze sweeping down from the eastern hills
was like a draught of invigorating wine. As he leaned
out for an instant to make sure that not even the
height would bring a return of the vertigo, the wail
of the nearest newsboy became shrilly articulate:
<i>"Here's yer Morning Plainsman! All erbout the great
election frauds!"</i></p>

<p>Hardly crediting his ears, Blount listened again,
and when the cry was repeated he closed the window
softly and sat down to grapple with this newest
development of his problem. Did the newsboy's
selling-cry mean that Blenkinsop had found out for
himself, and independently, about the falsified registration
lists? If so, there would be no public vindication
for one Evan Blount; but also&#8212;thank God!&#8212;no
need for a son to blazon himself to the world
as his father's accuser. A great wave of thankfulness
rolled over Blount's head, submerging him and
turning the exclamation which sprang to his lips
into a pæan of rejoicing. Instantly he saw himself
throwing up his railroad connection and taking his
rightful place as his father's counsel and defender.
Here, at last, was a cause into which he could fling
himself body and soul. True, people would say
that he had been in league with the corporations,
the boss, and the machine, from the first, but what
did that matter?</p>

<p>But would his father need a defender? No
shadow of doubt as to this was admissible in the
face of the accumulating evidence, he told himself.
From the opening day of the campaign the machine
and the corporations had been working hand in
hand; Gryson and his fellow-crooks were the sufficient
proof; and besides.... Blount reached under
the mattress and drew out the wrapped package,
untying the string with fingers that trembled.
A cursory examination of the affidavits sufficed. In
Gryson's sworn statement, and in two others, the
"Big Boss" was inculpated definitely and by name.</p>

<p>Blount glanced at the little clock on the dressing-case.
The early Sunday morning silence still prevailed
in the great hotel, and his resolve was quickly
taken. Dressing hurriedly, he went up to his own
room, and after a shave, a bath, and a freshening
change which included the removal of the disfiguring bandage,
he put on a close-fitting silk travelling-cap
under the soft hat and went down to the lobby.</p>

<p>There were but few guests stirring at that hour,
and Blount had the writing-room to himself when
he bought a copy of <i>The Plainsman</i> and turned anxiously
to the editorial page. After the first thrilling
of relief born of the newsboy's cry, an unnerving fear
had crept in to whisper that possibly the facts might
not bear out the thankful assumption. A rapid
reading of Blenkinsop's editorial confirmed the fear,
and the reader's lips grew dry and his breath came
quickly when he realized that the submerging wave
of thankfulness had risen only to be driven back.
Blenkinsop had no facts, no evidence; he was merely
hitting out blindly with a general accusation of fraud
which he made no effort to substantiate or prove!</p>

<p>Evan Blount saw the thorny path stretching away
before him again, and he rose up to walk in it like
a man. As once before, he went down to the railroad
restaurant for his breakfast, seeking solitude,
and the meal had been half-absently eaten before
he had readjusted himself, sorrowfully but firmly,
to the unchanged situation. His duty was as clearly
defined now as it had been the day previous, or at
any time in the past. There was nothing changed,
nothing different, save that a new complication had
arisen in the crucial shortness of the interval for action.
Knowing human nature a little, he knew how
difficult it is to arouse an effective public sentiment
on the eve of an election, no matter how important
the issues involved. In a hard school of experience
the voter has learned to discount the final-moment
cry of fraud. Would an exposure, however convincing,
appearing only in the Monday and Tuesday
morning newspapers have the desired effect?</p>

<p>Blount walked by devious ways from the railroad
station to the Temple Court, and secluded himself
behind the locked door of his office to have a chance
to think the problem out to some effective conclusion.
What should he do? Should he find Blenkinsop
and get him and the United Press representative
together at once, laying before them the
damning evidence and telling them to use it as they
could? Or was there some surer way of firing the
mine of protest and exposure?</p>

<p>There was one other way, at least, but the mere
thought of it made him sick and shaken. As an
upright citizen and a member of the bar, was it
not his duty to lay the evidence, not before the public
in the newspapers, but before a competent court
of justice? And in that event, was there in this
land of graft and corruption a judge sufficiently
fearless and incorruptible to act with the needful
vigor and promptness?</p>

<p>When Blount asked himself this question, the
answer came quickly. Though it was the common
accusation, well or ill founded, that the lower courts
of the State were the creatures of the corporations,
the judges on the supreme bench still commanded
the respect of the people. Hemingway, the chief
justice, was peculiarly a man for a crisis; strong,
honest, and entirely fearless; a man who would not
stop to haggle over nice questions of precedent and
jurisdiction where the public welfare demanded
prompt and effective action.</p>

<p>For a long half-hour Blount sat staring absently
at the desk litter, trying to decide between the
two courses open to him. He knew that his father
and Judge Hemingway had been lifelong friends,
and this added another drop of bitterness to a cup
which was already overflowing. None the less, he
was confident that the judge would do his duty as
he saw it. It was a merciless thing to do&#8212;to
make this just judge the slayer of the friend of his
youth; but at the end Blount reached for the
telephone-book and began to search for the chief
justice's residence number. Before he could find it
the phone bell rang.</p>

<p>"Well?" he answered shortly, putting the receiver
to his ear.</p>

<p>It was Miss Anners who was at the other end of
the wire, and he was instantly aware of the note of
anxiety in her voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Evan!</i>" she exclaimed; "you don't know what a
fright you have given us! What are you doing at
your office when you ought to be here and in bed?"</p>

<p>Blount drew the desk instrument closer and tried
to put her off lightly.</p>

<p>"I'm all right again. I turned out early this
morning to make up for lost time. You wouldn't
expect me to stay in bed for more than a day to
oblige a common, ordinary coach-dog, would you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but see here&#8212;listen: Doctor Dillon has
been here, and he is perfectly shocked. He says
there may be complications, and the very least you
can do is to be careful. Your father has had the
hotel boys looking everywhere for you. When are
you coming back?"</p>

<p>Here was the direct question which Blount had
been dreading. Now, if never before, the wretched
involvement had reached a point beyond which it
was impossible to follow his father's plea for a continuance
of the kinsman amenities.</p>

<p>"I think you had better leave me out of any plans
you are making for the day," he answered evasively.
"I shall be pretty busy."</p>

<p>"No&#8212;listen," she insisted. "It's wrong to work
on Sunday, but if you will be obstinate, you must
stop at luncheon-time. We are going to drive out
to Wartrace Hall this afternoon; Doctor Dillon says
we positively <i>must</i> take you away from town and
keep you quiet for a few days."</p>

<p>"I can't go with you," he answered brusquely,
adding: "And I'm not sure that I can join you at
luncheon. There is so much to be done that I shall
probably drop around to the club for a bite at one
o'clock. Don't wait for me, and don't worry.
Above all, please don't tell anybody where I am&#8212;not
even Dick Gantry."</p>

<p>He was considerably relieved when she said
"Good-by" rather abruptly, and rang off. None
the less, he thought it a little strange that his father
should be planning to leave the capital on the very
eve of the great struggle. Was he so sure that nothing
could happen within the next twenty-four hours?
Leaving the query answerless, he returned to the
interrupted duty. Deliberately, with the open telephone-book
before him, he sought and found Judge
Hemingway's number; and a few seconds later he
had the judge's house in Mesa Circle, with the
judge himself answering his call. The wire conversation
was brief and to the point. Cautiously, and
in well-guarded phrase, Blount stated his case. By
a series of correlated incidents which could be explained
later, documentary evidence of a great conspiracy
had fallen into his hands; would the judge
step aside so far as to accord him a Sunday interview,
taking his word for it that the emergency was
most urgent, and that the time was too short to
admit of the ordinary methods of procedure?</p>

<p>The judge's answer was satisfactory, though
Blount fancied it was rather reluctantly given. A
family engagement&#8212;an accepted luncheon invitation&#8212;would
intervene; but between four and five
o'clock in the afternoon the chief justice would be
in his chambers in the Capitol building, and would
be glad to have the son of his old friend the senator
come at that hour.</p>

<p>With time on his hands, Blount squared himself
at his desk and began to set his railroad house in
order. Now that the dreadful step was practically
taken, he was free to wind up the business of his
office, leaving things in order for his successor. Once
he had thought that he could not stay in the capital
or in the West after the cataclysm. But now the
manlier thought prevailed. A hard fate was making
him his father's betrayer; but beyond the betrayal,
with the bare duty done, he would take his place
as his father's son, proving his love and loyalty by
going down with him to any depth of infamy into
which the cataclysm might drag him.</p>

<p>Since there was much to be done in the winding-up
task, the forenoon fled quickly, and the hands of the
small paper-weight clock on the desk were pointing
to a quarter of two when Blount snapped the rubber
band upon the final file of referred papers. There
were other odds and ends to be set in order, but he
determined to let them wait until he had eaten. A
scant half-hour in the club grill-room was all he allowed
himself, and at a quarter past two he was
back at his desk, preparing to make the cleaning-up
task complete. Between four and five, Judge Hemingway
had said; and Blount began on one of the
odds and ends, which was the writing of his letter
of resignation from the railroad service.</p>

<p>He was enclosing the letter when there came a light
tap at the office-door, and then the door itself opened
to admit Patricia&#8212;a Patricia bright-eyed and determined,
alluringly charming in her tightly veiled driving-hat,
muffling motor-coat, and dainty gauntlets.</p>

<p>"You?" said Blount not too hospitably. "I
thought you said something about going to Wartrace?"</p>

<p>"So I did, and so I am," she asserted, coming to
sit in the chair last occupied by one Thomas Gryson.</p>

<p>"And the others?" he queried.</p>

<p>"They have just left; gone on ahead in the touring-car.
I was deputed to bring you."</p>

<p>"But I told you this morning that I couldn't go,
and I can't!" he protested.</p>

<p>She looked him squarely in the eye. "Evan, you
don't dare tell me why you can't!"</p>

<p>"Business," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"That may be half of the truth, but it isn't any
more than half." Then she made the direct appeal:
"I wish you'd tell me, Evan. I know a little&#8212;just
the little that Mrs. Blount has seen fit to tell me&#8212;and
no more. There is trouble threatening; some
dreadful trouble. I saw it yesterday when you were
so miserable; I can see it in your eyes this minute."</p>

<p>Blount got up and began to pace the floor so that
she might not see his eyes. He was no more proof
against such an appeal than any lover gladly ready
to bare his soul to the woman chosen out of a world
of women for his confidant and second self would be.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," he affirmed, wheeling abruptly
to face her; "I wanted to tell you yesterday, only
it was too horrible. You will know it all when I
say that by this time to-morrow the whole State
will be ringing with the story of David Blount's
degradation and ruin; and I&#8212;his only son, Patricia&#8212;I
shall be the one who will have betrayed him and
brought it to pass!"</p>

<p>She blanched a little at that, and there was a
great horror in her eyes. But he noted at the
moment, and remembered it afterward, that she did
not push him into the harrowing details, as another
woman might have done.</p>

<p>"You are very sure, I suppose?" she said gently.</p>

<p>He drew the packet of affidavits from his pocket.</p>

<p>"This is the evidence: sworn statements incriminating
my father and many others."</p>

<p>"You had those papers yesterday?"</p>

<p>"No. I got up last night to keep my appointment
with the man who brought them. But you see now
why I can't go to Wartrace with you."</p>

<p>"I see that you are going to do something for
which you will never, never be able to forgive yourself,"
she said gravely. "You are going to make
use of those papers?"</p>

<p>He sat down and stared gloomily at her. "Patricia,
I have taken a solemn oath. The law which
I have sworn to uphold is greater than&#8212;" He was
going to say, "greater than any man's claim for immunity,"
but she finished the sentence otherwise for
him.</p>

<p>"Is greater than your love for your father. I
suppose I ought to be able to understand that, but
I am not. Evan, you can't do it&#8212;you mustn't do
it; every drop of that father's blood in your veins
ought to cry out against it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed with a sudden indrawing of
his breath. "You don't know what it is costing me!"</p>

<p>"Truly, I don't," she asserted calmly. "Your
father is a great and good man. If he had a daughter
instead of a son, she would know and understand."
Then, in a quick and generous upflash of
feeling: "I wish he had a daughter&#8212;I wish I were
she! I should try to show him that blood is thicker
than water!"</p>

<p>"You wish&#8212;you were&#8212;his daughter? Do you
realize what you are saying?" Then he went on
brokenly: "<i>Don't</i>, Patricia, girl&#8212;for God's sake
don't tempt me to do evil that good may come!
Can't you understand how I am driven to do this
thing&#8212;how every fibre of me is rebelling against
the savage necessity? God knows, I'd give anything
I am or hope to be if the necessity could be
wiped out!"</p>

<p>Instantly she changed her attack.</p>

<p>"But I say you can not do it. You are a brave
man, Evan; I know, because I have seen you tried.
You mustn't turn cowardly now."</p>

<p>"Nor shall I!" he countered quickly. "But I
don't understand."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Isn't it cowardly to strike this
cruel blow in the dark? You <i>can't</i> do this thing
without giving your father the warning that you
would give your bitterest enemy&#8212;you simply can't,
and still be the man I have known and l&#8212;liked for
two whole years!"</p>

<p>"Father's going to Wartrace this afternoon is
merely an added twist of the thumb-screws," he
protested in fresh wretchedness. "I should have
gone to him first&#8212;I meant to go to him first. From
what you said over the telephone this morning I
gathered that the Wartrace trip was to be made on
my account, and I hoped, I believed, it would be
given up when I refused to go. Now I can not see
him first; the time is too short. That which is to
be done must be done to-day&#8212;this afternoon; otherwise
it will be too late. Don't make it any harder
for me, Patricia. Surely you can see how hard it is,
in any case!"</p>

<p>"As I said a moment ago, I can see that you are
about to do something for which, in all the years
to come, you will never be able to get your own
forgiveness. Oh, I know," she went on bitterly.
"You will tell me that I am a woman, with only a
woman's standards, which are valueless when they
get mixed up with the emotions. But I can tell
you that I know your father better than you do&#8212;much
better. And I believe in him, utterly, absolutely.
Won't you give him a chance, Evan? Won't
you show him those dreadful papers and ask him
what he will do when you have betrayed him?"</p>

<p>Blount winced painfully at the hard word, and
then he remembered that he had been the first to
apply it. But he answered her in the only way
that seemed possible:</p>

<p>"The time: I have promised to meet Chief Justice
Hemingway at his chambers between four and
five this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Chief Justice Hemingway?" she queried. "Why,
he&#8212;" she broke off suddenly and sprang from her
chair. "I have the little car here in the street. It
was Mrs. Blount's proposal; she said you would
change your mind if I came after you and offered
to drive you. Come! I'll promise to bring you
back before five o'clock. I know the time is awfully
short, but I can do it!"</p>

<p>If Blount hesitated it was only because her beauty
and her eagerness thrilled him until, for the moment,
he could think of nothing else. Then he closed his
desk quickly and struggled into his overcoat, saying:
"It shall be as you wish. Let's go."</p>

<h3>IN WHICH PATRICIA DRIVES</h3>


<p>For fifteen miles north of the capital the Quaretaro
road is a well-kept, level speedway, and Miss
Anners amply proved the worth of her summer's
training by showing herself a fearless driver. Half
an hour after the small roadster had left the curb
in front of the Temple Court Building it was among
the hills and climbing to the upper mesa level.</p>

<p>Nearing the mouth of Shonoho Canyon, they
overtook and passed a horseman turning into the
canyon road. The man's horse shied and threatened
to bolt at sight of the storming car, but Patricia
was looking straight ahead, and she made no movement
to slacken speed. At the passing glimpse,
Blount's mind went shuttling backward to the homecoming
night in the Lost Hills, and he made sure he
recognized the rider as Hathaway's morose henchman,
the man Barto.</p>

<p>He wondered vaguely what Barto could be doing
at the turn in the obstructed side-canyon road,
and the wonder went with him while the little car
was covering the remaining distance and flying up
the cottonwood-shaded avenue at Wartrace Hall.
But a glance at his watch made him forget the
Barto incident in a heart-warming thrill of admiration&#8212;the
joy of a skilled motorist recognizing
kindred skill in another. The thirty miles from
the city had been made in something under fifty
minutes.</p>

<p>When she brought the roadster to a stand at the
carriage entrance, Patricia spoke for the first time
since she had taken the wheel for the record-breaking
drive.</p>

<p>"Find your father quickly and say to him what
you have come to say. When you are ready to go
back, I'll keep my promise and drive you."</p>

<p>"That won't be at all necessary," he protested,
getting out to stand with his hand on the dash. "I
am perfectly well able to drive myself; and, besides,
it would leave you at the wrong end of the road,
and alone."</p>

<p>"Don't stand there talking about it," she commanded.
"Go and do what you have to do. I'll
wait here."</p>

<p>Blount turned away and found old Barnabas
holding the door open for him. A word passed,
and the old negro bobbed his head. "Yas, sah;
Marsteh David's in de libra'y," was the answer to
Blount's query, and, throwing his overcoat and soft
hat aside, the bearer of burdens not his own walked
quickly through the hall and let himself into the
room of trial.</p>

<p>The bright autumn day was cool&#8212;cool enough to
warrant the crackling wood-fire on the library hearth.
With his easy chair planted at the cosey corner of the
fire and an open book on the table at his elbow, the
senator sat smoking his long-stemmed pipe in the
Sunday afternoon quiet. Mingled with the fire-snapping
there were faint tappings, as if one of the
cottonwoods, growing too near the house, were
sending twig signals to the inmates.</p>

<p>The senator moved the open book a little farther
aside when his son made an abrupt entrance into
the cheerful room.</p>

<p>"Well, son, you made out to get here after so
long a time, didn't you?" he said gently. And then:
"How's the broken head to-day?"</p>

<p>"Better," answered the son shortly, adding: "It's
the least of my troubles just now."</p>

<p>"That's good," was the hearty comment. Then,
with the long stem of the pipe pointing to a Morris-chair:
"Draw up and sit down. I reckon the drive
has tired you some, even if you won't admit it.
Where's the little girl?"</p>

<p>Evan Blount saw instantly that he must be brief
and pitiless.</p>

<p>"Patricia is waiting in the car to drive me back
to town," he explained, forcing himself to speak
calmly. "I have an appointment with Chief Justice
Hemingway which must be kept, and he will
wait in his chambers in the Capitol only until five
o'clock. Father, do you know why I have made
that appointment?"</p>

<p>The senator wagged his great head in a way which
might mean anything or nothing, and said: "How
should I know, son?"</p>

<p>"I hoped you would know. It's not a very pleasant
task for me to tell you," the younger man went
on, ignoring the chair to which the long-stemmed
pipe was still pointing. "A short time ago&#8212;yesterday,
to be exact&#8212;evidence, legal evidence, of corruption
and false registration in four of the city wards,
and in a number of outlying districts in the
State, was put into my hands. This evidence incriminates
a group of ringleaders and a still larger
number of election officers. You know what I've
got to do with it."</p>

<p>The older man nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon I know, son; and I'm not saying
a word. If you weren't a Blount, I might ask if
you haven't learned that one of the first rules in the
book of politics is the one that says we mustn't hang
the dirty clothes out where everybody can see 'em,
but I know better than to say anything like that to
you."</p>

<p>The young man's heart sank within him. It
seemed evident that his father was still unsuspecting,
still unconscious of the dreadful consequences
to himself. Only utter frankness could avail now.</p>

<p>"I can't discuss the question of expediency with
you," he said hastily, "any further than to say that
I'd cheerfully give ten years of my life to be able
to consider it. Let me be perfectly plain: This evidence
I am speaking of involves you personally. If
the papers are put into Judge Hemingway's hands
there will be a searching investigation, prompt indictments,
criminal proceedings, and all the disgrace
that the widest publicity can bring upon the
men who are responsible for the present desperate
state of affairs."</p>

<p>The senator had laid his pipe aside and was staring
soberly into the fire. "Go on, son," he said
quietly; "let's have the rest of it."</p>

<p>"You know what has led up to the present
wretched involvement&#8212;my involvement," Blount
went on. "When I took the railroad job, I did it
in good faith and went about preaching the gospel
of the square deal for everybody, including the corporations.
But in a very short time I discovered
that my own people were not keeping faith with
me; had no intention of keeping it. Later on, a
number of corporation officials and managers, men
who had formerly made corrupt deals with the railroad
company, and are to this day profiting by
them, became frightened. Assuming that I was the
chief broker for the railroad company in the present
campaign, these men wrote me letters which
were in the highest degree incriminating."</p>

<p>The big man who was staring into the heart of
the fire nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I remember; you told me something about that
before, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we needn't go into the details again.
I meant to use those letters as a club to hammer a
little honesty into my own employers. Up to that
time I had been trying to believe that the machine&#8212;your
machine&#8212;and the railroad lawbreakers were
not one and the same thing."</p>

<p>"But you changed your mind about that?"</p>

<p>"I had to, after I found out that you had corrupted
one of my clerks and had sent one of your
thugs to dynamite my safe. That is past and gone;
but you can see where it left me. As you and
everybody in the State know, I had been committing
myself publicly everywhere, doing it with the assurance
that when it came to the pinch I could bring
Gantry and Kittredge and even Mr. McVickar himself
to terms&#8212;the terms of honesty and fair dealing.
With my weapon stolen, I was left helpless, facing
the certainty that on the day after the election I
should be pilloried in every hole and corner of my
native State as the most shameless liar that ever
breathed. Do you wonder that I was desperate?"</p>

<p>"No, son; I reckon you wouldn't have been much
of a Blount if you hadn't been."</p>

<p>"I was desperate. I said to myself that I would
find another weapon, even if I should have to take
a leaf out of your own book, dad, to do it. I took
the leaf, and I have the weapon. You drove Gryson
away, but you made one small miscalculation.
You didn't believe that his desire for revenge would
be stronger than his fear of the gallows."</p>

<p>Again the older man nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, son; I know. He came back twice: once
when he found you in your office last Wednesday
night; and again yesterday, or rather last evening,
when you got out of your bed and went to help
him make his getaway on the east-bound Overland."</p>

<p>Evan Blount started back, and his exclamation
was of pure astoundment.</p>

<p>"You knew all this?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I reckon there isn't much happening
that such a double-dyed old villain as I am doesn't
find out, Evan," was the sober rejoinder.</p>

<p>"But, good heavens! if you know so much, you
must know what Gryson came back for, and what
he gave me!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I know that, too. I reckon I might as
well make a clean breast of it while I'm at it."</p>

<p>"You knew it last night, and yet you didn't send
somebody to hold me up and take the papers away
from me?"</p>

<p>The senator's chuckle rumbled deep in his mighty
chest.</p>

<p>"Maybe I was counting a little on the kinship,
Evan, boy. Maybe I was saying to myself: 'No,
I reckon the boy won't do it, after all&#8212;not when
he reads what's set down in the papers; he just
naturally couldn't do it.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord, dad!" was the choking response.
"Can't you see that you are killing me by inches?
Can't you see that I've got to choose between being
a man clear through, or a scoundrel as weak and
shifty as any of those I have been denouncing?
My God, it's terrible!"</p>

<p>"I reckon you're going to choose straight," said
the older man, still with eyes averted.</p>

<p>"I have chosen," said the son brokenly; "or perhaps
it would be truer to say that there never has
been any choice since the moment when I set my
foot in the path which has led me thus far on the
way to hell. I can despise myself utterly for the
means I took to secure the evidence, but that very
lapse makes it all the more needful that I should
atone as I can."</p>

<p>David Blount rose and put his back to the fire.</p>

<p>"Son, you are a man among a thousand&#8212;among
ten thousand," he said quietly. "When it comes
to a pure question of good, old-fashioned right and
wrong, you can buck up just like your old great-gran'pap,
the judge, did when he had to sentence
one of his own sons for killing an Indian. You
haven't said it in so many words, so I'll say it for
you: you've got me, and maybe some others, right
where you can shove us into the penitentiary.
That's about what you're trying to tell me, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't put it that way!" Blount
protested. "I gave you fair warning almost at the
first. I've got to fight for the right as I see it. If
I don't, I shall be less than a man&#8212;less than your
son. Can't you see that it is breaking my heart?"</p>

<p>A silence electrically surcharged with possibilities
settled down upon the isolated room, with the stillness
broken only by the crackling of the fire and
that other distant tapping as of tree-twigs on the
roof. At the end of the pause the senator took a
forward step and put a hand on his son's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I haven't one word to say, Evan, boy," he began
slowly. "As you told me that first day out here,
son, it's your job to hew to the line and let the chips
fall where they may. You go ahead and do just
what seems right and law-abiding to you. I'd rather
go to jail twice over than have you do any different.
Is that what you're wanting me to say?"</p>

<p>Blount dropped into a chair, as if the touch on
his shoulder had crushed him, and covered his face
with his hands. It was hard&#8212;harder than even his
own prefigurings had forecast it. Fighting against
the patent facts, he had been cherishing a lingering
hope that his father might be able to brush away
the cruel necessity at the last moment. But now
the hope was dead.</p>

<p>It was a long minute before he staggered to his
feet and groped his way to the door, leaving his
father standing before the fire and once more puffing
absently at the long-stemmed pipe. When old Barnabas
had helped him into his coat and had given
him his hat, he found Patricia still sitting in the car,
with the motor purring softly under the hood.</p>

<p>"Must you go back?" she queried, when he had
descended the steps to climb stiffly into the seat
beside her.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Your duty is clear?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly clear&#8212;now."</p>

<p>"And the consequences?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can only guess," he muttered. "Ruin and
disgrace for all of us, I suppose. Of course, you
understand that I have resigned from the railroad
service and shall stand with my father when&#8212;when
the thing is done."</p>

<p>She was backing the little roadster into the circling
driveway to turn for the start. At the reversing
moment she made her final plea.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Evan&#8212;<i>don't do it!</i> I have no more
than a woman's reason to offer, but I am sure you
are opening the door to a lifelong sorrow for yourself
and&#8212;and&#8212;for me!"</p>

<p>It was the last two words that steeled him suddenly.
Not even at her beseeching would he turn
aside from the plain path of the oath-bound obligation.
It struck him like a blow that the turning
aside would make him forever unworthy of her.</p>

<p>"Take me back to the city as quickly as you can!"
he said. "Or, better still, stay here and let me have
the car. That is my last word."</p>

<p>"You're not fit to drive a car!" she snapped; and
for further answer she threw the speed lever into the
intermediate gear and released the clutch. Like a
projectile hurled from a catapult, the swift little
roadster shot away down the cottonwood avenue,
and with a jerk of the lever into the "high" the
second race against time was begun.</p>

<p>For the first few miles Patricia's passenger had
all he could do to keep his seat. On its upper mesa
windings the Quaretaro road follows the course of
the stream which has been robbed of its waters for
the cultivated lands, and though the roadway was
good the hazards were plentiful when taken at speed.
More than once Blount caught himself in the act
of reaching for the steering-wheel, but as often he
desisted. As on the outward race, Patricia was
staring straight ahead, and giving the little car
every throb of speed there was in its machinery.
None the less, he could see that she had it under
perfect control.</p>

<p>What finally happened came with the suddenness
of the thunder-clap following a bolt which strikes
near at hand. They were on the down-grade approach
to the mouth of Shonoho Canyon, and they
could not see beyond the gentle curve to the left,
where the smaller gulch found its intersection with
the main ravine. When they were within a hundred
yards of the curve the stretch below came into
view. Blount had a momentary glimpse of some
barrier&#8212;a pine-tree, as it proved to be&#8212;lying across
the main road. Seeing it, he realized at the same
instant that Patricia was neither throttling the motor
nor applying the brakes. After that he had barely
time to snap the switch and to throw the heavy
wind-shield down before the devastating crash came.</p>

<h3>THE GOSSIPING WIRES</h3>


<p>After his son had left him, the Honorable Senator
Sage-Brush remained standing before the library
fire until he heard the machine-gun exhausts
of the small roadster distance-diminishing down the
driveway avenue. Then he stepped aside and pressed
the bell-push ordinarily used to summon the old
negro footman.</p>

<p>In answer to the call a door opened beyond the
chimney-jamb, and immediately the gentle twig-tapping
sounds resolved themselves into the clickings
of a pair of telegraph relays and the chatter of
a typewriter. A good-looking young fellow, with
his coat off, entered the library, carefully closing the
door behind him.</p>

<p>"Want to send something, senator?" he asked,
whipping a note-book from his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>"No, not just this minute. Anything new coming
over the wires?"</p>

<p>"Nothing startling. Steuchfield reports from
Ophir that we swing the miners' vote almost to a
man unless something unforeseen breaks loose.
Hetchy gives us a good word from Twin Buttes; and
Griggs, up in the Carnadines, wires from Alkire that
he has just completed an auto canvass of the High
Line district. The ranchmen up that way have had
a pretty bad scare. There was a threat made that
the price of water was going to be raised. But they're
all right now."</p>

<p>The boss nodded approvingly. Then: "How about
those microphone notes?"</p>

<p>"Crowell is writing them off," was the reply.
"He'll have them in half an hour or so."</p>

<p>The senator drew out his watch, a huge thick-crystalled
time-piece dating back to the range-riding
period.</p>

<p>"As matters have turned out, I shall be going to
the city before long," he said. "If the notes are not
ready before I leave, you can order out the speed-car
and send them in by Gallagher any time before six
o'clock. Don't slip up on that, Fred; tell Gallagher
to deliver the notes to me, in person, at the Inter-Mountain.
What's become of Professor Anners?"</p>

<p>"He's staying over at Haworth's ranch, just to
be near the fossil bone-field. They've made another
plesio-something find, and Haworth telephones that
the professor couldn't be dragged away with a derrick
until those bones are safely out of the ground
and boxed for shipment."</p>

<p>The professor's host smiled indulgently, saying:
"It's just as well, I reckon. The professor's about
as blind as a bat when it comes to seeing anything
this side of a million years ago, but if he were here
he might wonder why we've set up a telegraph-office&#8212;wonder,
and talk about it."</p>

<p>The young man in his shirt-sleeves was turning to
go. "I'll hustle Crowell on those notes," he promised:
but as he was reaching for the door-knob the senator
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Fred; how is that contrivance
of ours at the mouth of Shonoho working?"</p>

<p>"It's working all right. Canby is on watch there
now, and he says he can see everything that passes
on both roads."</p>

<p>"That's good. These little precautions are mighty
necessary in a close fight. Those folks over at Shonoho
Inn ought to have thought of this outer-guard
business for themselves, but it seems they didn't.
They'd be right awkwardly embarrassed if some fellow
they don't want to see should slip in on 'em without
notice. While I think of it, don't fail to keep me
posted on what Canby sees after I go back to town.
He thinks he's safe, does he?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Nobody can see his dugout from the
road, and his oil-heater doesn't make any smoke.
That scheme of laying insulated wires on the ground
works like a charm. You could walk all over them
without noticing them." The young man was opening
the door as he spoke, and he broke off suddenly
to say: "That's his call ringing now. Would you
like to come and talk to him?"</p>

<p>"No; you can tell me what he says, if it's worth
telling."</p>

<p>The clerk disappeared into the room of the tapping
noises, but he was back again almost immediately.</p>

<p>"It was Canby," he said hurriedly. "He says two
men on horseback have just dragged a good-sized
pine-tree down the Shonoho road and are placing
it across the county road. He can't see the men's
faces very well, but he thinks the bigger of the two
is Jack Barto."</p>

<p>It was the senator's boast that he had never lost
a tooth or had one filled, and his smile showed the
double row, strong and evenly matched, under the
drooping grayish mustaches.</p>

<p>"That boy Canby is a mighty good guesser, Fred.
I shouldn't be surprised if the fellow he has spotted
<i>is</i> Jack Barto, sure enough. If you didn't know
beforehand what a good-natured, meechin' sort of
rooster Jack is, you might think he was fixing to play
some kind of a hold-up game on somebody."</p>

<p>"That's what Canby thinks, and he asked me to
hold the wire open."</p>

<p>The big boss smiled again. "Then don't you
reckon you'd better go and hold it?" he suggested
mildly; and the young man in his shirt-sleeves vanished
to do it.</p>

<p>When he was left alone, the senator went to the
house phone connecting the library with the remoter
suites. A touch of the button brought an
answering word, and he spoke softly into the transmitter.</p>

<p>"The time is getting right ripe, and I thought you
might want a minute or so to put on your things,"
he said, in answer to the low-toned "Well?" that
came over the house wire. Then he added: "I don't
know but what we may have to make a little bluff
at somebody on the way in. When you order the
car around, suppose you tell Rickert to put 'Tennessee'
and Billy Shack in the tonneau, with a couple
of shot-guns. We can drop 'em if they look too
warlike and conspicuous."</p>

<p>He was hanging the ear-piece on its hook when the
shirt-sleeved young man burst in again excitedly.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a hold-up!" he declared breathlessly. "Miss
Anners and Mr. Evan have slammed their car into
the tree, and Canby says the two horseback men are
watching them from the dry gulch just below him!"</p>

<p>"All right," was the even-toned reply. "You go
and tell Canby to keep his shirt on, Fred; and don't
forget to send those papers in by Gallagher."</p>

<p>While the senator was speaking, the door opened
and the old negro came hobbling in with a driving-coat
and the broad-brimmed planter's hat which
made the Honorable David a marked man throughout
the length and breadth of the Sage-Brush State.</p>

<p>"De cyar's at de do', Marsteh David, and Mistis
say she plumb ready when you is, yes-sah," stammered
the serving-man, holding the coat for his
master; and a moment later the senator was climbing
to his place behind the big wheel of the touring-car,
with Mrs. Honoria for his seat-mate on the
mechanician's side, and the chauffeur, the horse
wrangler, and Billy Shack comfortably filling the
tonneau.</p>

<p>While the touring-car, with its curiously assorted
complement of passengers, was leaving Wartrace
Hall, Evan Blount, having assured himself that Patricia
was not hurt, was trying to estimate the extent
of the damage done to the little red roadster
by the collision with the tree. The inspection was
brief. With the front axle bent and the radiator
crushed, the car was safely out of commission.</p>

<p>"We're definitely out of the fight," he reported
shortly, helping his companion down from the driving-seat.</p>

<p>Patricia was still trembling and pale.</p>

<p>"You mean that we can't go on to the city?" she
quavered.</p>

<p>"Not unless we walk; and of course that is out
of the question."</p>

<p>"Then you&#8212;you can't keep your appointment
with Judge Hemingway."</p>

<p>Blount's smile was scornful. "I imagine it was no
part of my father's plans that I should keep my appointment,"
he commented bitterly. "He took it
for granted that I would drive out to Wartrace with
you, and made his preparations accordingly. This
tree wasn't here half an hour ago, and it is here now."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it of him," she denied, and her
lip quivered. And then she added: "Just think,
Evan; we might have been killed&#8212;both of us!"</p>

<p>Blount's teeth came together with a little clicking
noise. "Politics, or what passes for politics in this
God-forsaken region, seems to make no account of
such a small thing as a human life or two," he said.
And then: "I suppose we are due to wait until
somebody comes along to pick us up. It's four
miles or more back to the nearest ranch on the mesa."</p>

<p>"It is all my fault!" lamented the young woman.
"I&#8212;I might have stopped the car, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I wondered a little that you didn't at least try
to stop it," he permitted himself to say; and at this
she forgot the traditions, sociological or other, reverting
to the type of the eternal feminine.</p>

<p>"Say it all," she flashed out. "You are beginning
to wonder if I didn't do it purposely. I <i>did</i> do it
purposely. All the way along I had been trying to
muster up courage enough to smash the car in the
ditch, and if I hadn't been such a coward I would
have done it. Now hate me, if you want to!"</p>

<p>Blount would have been less the lover than he was
if he had not been moved to something much warmer
than hatred.</p>

<p>"Let us say that you are doing your level best to
save my faith in human nature, Patricia, girl," he
said soberly. "Do you know what you are? You
are the one loyal person in a tricky world. I am
still fair enough to say that it was fine&#8212;splendid!
And I only wish my father were worthier of such
superb loyalty and affection."</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously for a moment. Then
her mood changed in the twinkling of an eye, and
she laughed and said: "Yes, I think women are more
loyal than men; and I am sure they are vastly more
discerning at times. Don't you think&#8212;&#8212;"</p>

<p>The interruption was the appearance of two horsemen
pushing their animals out of a small gorge on
the right. When they had gained the main road
they came up, ambling easily, and Blount instantly
recognized the leader of the pair. It was Barto
again.</p>

<p>"Howdy?" said the timber-looker, riding up to
hang with one knee over the saddle while he grinned
genially at the two castaways. "Lost out ag'in,
ain't ye, Mr. Blount? Couldn't make out, nohow,
to run yer chug-wagon over that there pine-tree,
could ye?"</p>

<p>"Did you put the tree in the road?" snapped
Blount, his anger rising promptly, now that there
was a man to quarrel with.</p>

<p>"I reckon we did; and it was one Hades of a job,
too," was the cool reply. "Had to drag the dern
thing f'r more'n half a mile down the gulch with the
hawss-ropes."</p>

<p>Here was plenty of material for a wrathful explosion,
but Blount controlled himself.</p>

<p>"By whose orders did you do it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Th' boss's."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hathaway?"</p>

<p>"Not on yer life; it was the big boss this time."</p>

<p>Blount's quick glance aside at his companion was
a wordless "I told you so!" and then to Barto:
"Well, now that you have stopped us, what's next?"</p>

<p>The outlaw grinned again and kicked his horse a
little nearer.</p>

<p>"I'm a-holdin' you up sure enough this time, Mr.
Blount&#8212;jest like another little Billy th' Kid," he
confided. "You're goin' to gimme them papers
you've got in your pocket, and then me an' Kinky
we rides away all peaceful and leaves you and the
lady to set down quiet till somebuddy comes along
to pick you up."</p>

<p>Blount put his hand to his head. His wound was
throbbing painfully again, and the pain may have
been partly responsible for his answer.</p>

<p>"When you get those papers you'll take them
from a dead man, Barto. Do your instructions go
that far?"</p>

<p>The man of many trades swung straight in his
saddle and fell into the attitude of one listening.
Then the good-natured grin became a menacing
scowl.</p>

<p>"Shuck them papers out, and do it sudden!" he
commanded.</p>

<p>"No," said Blount crisply.</p>

<p>Instantly the timber-looker's pistol was out.</p>

<p>"Give 'em up!" he shouted; "shell 'em out,
quick, 'r by the holy&#8212;"</p>

<p>The interposition broke in stormily. Down the
grade from the upper mesa level came a touring-car,
with a big man at the wheel, a veiled woman
beside him, and three men in the tonneau. "Holy
smoke!" said the outlaw, and with his riding mate
was slipping away up the Shonoho road when the
touring-car, with brakes protesting, came to a stand
at the tree barrier. Like a flash, two of the three
men in the tonneau leaped out, and a charge of
buckshot whistling over the heads of the two obstructionists
halted them. Thereupon the Honorable
David gave his orders tersely.</p>

<p>"Tennessee, you go up yonder and argue with
Jack Barto a spell," he directed. "Tell him and his
partner that the Wartrace smoke-house is the safest
place in Quaretaro County for a couple of club-witted
bunglers like they are, and then you see to
it that they get there. You, Billy, help Rickert get
a tow-rope hitch on that road-car, and we'll see if
we can't jerk it out of the way." After which he
turned to his son as casually as if only the preconceived
and preconcerted had come to pass: "Tried
to wreck you, did they? Mighty near made a job
of it, too, from the looks of Miss Patty's little car.
Not hurt, are you? That's good. Climb in here,
both of you, and when we get this windfall out of
the road we'll go on to town."</p>

<p>Blount put Patricia into the empty tonneau
while Shack and the chauffeur were making the tow-rope
hitch, but he was still angry enough to hesitate
when it came his turn. A glance at his watch decided
him. It was still only half past four. Had his
father repented so far as to override the obstacle
which he himself had interposed? Patricia was
holding the tonneau-door open, and Blount got in
and took his seat beside her.</p>

<p>A small engineering feat, made possible by the
power plant of the big car and the tow-rope, soon
cleared the way of the wrecked roadster and the
tree. Then the senator gave another order.</p>

<p>"You and Billy stay here and see if you can't get
that roadster so you can run it to town on its own
power," he said to the chauffeur; and over his
shoulder to the pair behind him: "If you'll change
partners back there, and let Honoria ride on the
cushions&#8212;"</p>

<p>Though he could not remotely apprehend his
father's reason for the rearrangement, Blount got
out, helped Mrs. Honoria down and up again, and
then climbed into the seat she had just vacated.
At the click of the tonneau door-latch the big car
rolled on down the grade, and for a good half of the
straightaway fifteen miles to the city the younger
man held his peace grimly. Finally he turned to
his father and said:</p>

<p>"I'm blaming you for the tree, and for Barto's
attempt to get those papers away from me. Am I
wrong?"</p>

<p>The Honorable David shook his head.</p>

<p>"This close to an election you're mighty near safe
in blaming anybody and everybody in sight, son," he
returned gravely; and apart from this small break in
the monotony, the second half of the fifteen miles
went speechless.</p>

<p>The clock in the Temple Court tower was pointing
to five minutes of five when the senator, instead of
taking the direct street to the Inter-Mountain, as
his son expected him to, turned the car aside into
the Capitol grounds and brought it to rest before
the side entrance which led to the chambers of the
Supreme Court justices.</p>

<p>"You're still in time, Evan, boy," he intimated
gently; "and I'm only going to ask one thing of
you. When you get through with Hemingway, come
around to the hotel and show your grit by taking
dinner with the rest of us. Are you man enough to
do that?"</p>

<p>If the son hesitated, it was only for a fraction of a
second. When he answered, it was to say: "If I
were going up-stairs to put a noose around my own
neck, it would be simpler and easier than the thing
I've got to do. As to your one condition&#8212;dad, I'll
be with you at dinner, and at all other times, after
this thing is done. I've quit the railroad, and I
did it so that I might be free to be your son and your
lawyer when the smash comes. Can I say more?"</p>

<p>"You don't need to say another blessed word,
son," was the sober rejoinder; and when Evan
Blount got out, the Honorable David drove away
without a backward glance for the young man who
was dragging himself up the granite steps of the
Capitol entrance like a condemned criminal going
to execution.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIX" id="XXIX"></a>XXIX</h2>

<h3>AT SHONOHO INN</h3>


<p>Evan Blount's interview with the venerable
chief justice was not at all what he had imagined it
would be. To begin with, he found it blankly impossible
to take the attitude he had meant to take&#8212;namely,
that of a conscientious member of the
bar, rigorously ignoring all the little cross-currents
of human sympathy and the affections.</p>

<p>Almost at once he found himself telling his story
incident by incident to the kindly old man who was
figuring rather as a father confessor than as a judge
and a legal superior. When it was done, and the
chief justice had gone thoughtfully over the mass of
evidence, Blount saw no thunder-cloud of righteous
indignation gathering upon the judicial brow. Nor
was Judge Hemingway's comment in the least what
he had expected it would be.</p>

<p>"I can not commend too highly your prudence and
good judgment in bringing these papers to me, Mr.
Blount," was the form the comment took. "Your
position was a difficult one, and not one young man
in a hundred would have been judicious enough to
choose the conservative middle path you have
chosen. The fanatic would have rushed into print,
and the vast majority would have weakly compromised
with conscience. It is a source of the deepest
satisfaction to me, as your father's friend, to find
that you have done neither."</p>

<p>"As my father's friend?" echoed Blount.</p>

<p>"Yes, just that, Mr. Blount. There is an appreciation
which transcends the commonplace things of
life, and I don't know which is worthier of the greater
admiration, your courage in coming to me, or your
father's single-heartedness in urging you to do it
after he had learned the purport of these papers.
Yet this is what I should have expected of David
Blount as I know him. Men say of him that he has
sometimes wielded his tremendous political power
regardless of the law and of other men's rights.
But in the field of pure ethics, in the exercise of the
high and holy duty which is laid upon the man who
has become a father, I should look to find your father
doing precisely what he has done. I assure you
that it is not without reason that many of his fellow
citizens call him most affectionately the 'Honorable
Senator Sage-Brush.'"</p>

<p>"But the consequences!" gasped the unwilling informer.
"His name in those affidavits!"</p>

<p>The chief justice was nodding slowly.</p>

<p>"Without doubt a great crime has been committed,
and a still greater one is contemplated. We shall
take prompt action to defeat the contemplated
crime at the polls next Tuesday, rest assured of
that. But at the same time, let me say a word for
your comfort: these papers came to you from the
hands of a criminal, and that particular criminal
had&#8212;as I am well informed&#8212;every reason to be vindictively
enraged against your father. I am sure
you are too good a lawyer to fail to see the point.
If this man Gryson, in 'getting even,' as he expressed
it to you, has added perjury to his other crimes&#8212;But
we need not follow the suggestion any further
at this time. Be hopeful, Mr. Blount, as I am.
Leave these matters with me, and go and be as good
a son as he deserves to my old friend David."</p>

<p>Evan Blount left the venerable presence in the
judges' chambers of the Capitol with a heart strangely
mellowed, and with a feeling of relief too great to
be measured. At last, without compromise, and
equally without the slightest concession to the natural
human passion for vindication, the momentous
step had been taken. Whatever might come of it,
there would be no daggerings from an outraged conscience,
no remorse for an unworthy passion impulsively
yielded to. Also, with the rolling of the
terrible burden to other and entirely competent shoulders
there came a sense of freedom that was almost
jubilant; and under the promptings of this new light-heartedness
he was able to make a reasonably cheerful
fourth at the <i>café</i> dinner-table a little later.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, as he thought, Patricia was also
cheerful, though she vanished with Mrs. Honoria to
the private suite shortly after the adjournment to
the mezzanine lounge. Past this, after the father
and son had smoked their cigars in man-like silence
for a time, Mrs. Honoria, coated and hatted as if
to go out, came back to sit near the balustrade, looking
down upon the kindling lobby activities. Shortly
after her coming the senator rose to go. Instantly
his wife sprang up to walk with him to the head of
the great stair.</p>

<p>"The time has come?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I reckon it has, little woman."</p>

<p>"I wish I might be there to see," she said softly.
And then, whipping a packet of papers from under
her street-coat: "Take these. When you see what
they are, you'll know why I haven't given them to
you before this. As long as you didn't know anything
about it, you could tell Evan the simple truth&#8212;that
you didn't have them."</p>

<p>The Honorable David pocketed the papers without
looking at them.</p>

<p>"I suspected you&#8212;or, rather, young Collins&#8212;quite
a little spell ago," he said with imperturbable
good nature. "I couldn't have done it myself; I
reckon no right-minded man could have done it,
but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"&#8212;But women have no conscience," she finished
for him. "<i>I</i> hadn't in this instance. There was too
much at stake with a firebrand like Evan to deal
with. Don't be too good-natured, David&#8212;to-night,
I mean. You know that is your failing when you
have a man down. But to-night you must make
the man pay the price. That's all, I think. I'm
going back to Evan now to see if I can't make him
talk to me. That is the one thing I have seldom
been able to do thus far."</p>

<p>If Blount was a little surprised when the small
plotter came back to take the chair recently vacated
by his father, he was generous enough not to show
it. The huge sense of relief was still with him, and
its mellowing influence made him smile leniently
when she said: "I want to be reasoned with, Evan.
I have just let your father persuade me that a certain
thing he is about to do is perfectly safe, when I
am afraid it isn't."</p>

<p>"Since he is undertaking to do it, it's safe enough,
you may be sure," he replied at random.</p>

<p>"Then you know what it is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; he didn't tell me where he was going.
But on general principles, you know, I think he can
be trusted to take care of himself. He is a many-sided
man, Mrs. Blount. You are his wife, but I
have sometimes found myself wondering if, after
all, you know him as he really is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I don't," she agreed readily enough.
"But I do know his absolute fearlessness, at least.
That's why I'm a little nervous just now."</p>

<p>Blount took the alarm at once, as she hoped he
would.</p>

<p>"You mean that he is really going into danger of
some sort?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She nodded. "He is going to meet a man who is&#8212;well,
he is a big man with many of the same qualities
that your father has. But down at the very
bottom of him there is a quality that even your
father doesn't suspect. Have you ever seen a cornered
rat, Evan?"</p>

<p>Blount had got upon his feet and was buttoning
his coat.</p>

<p>"I don't know how much or how little you know
about what has taken place this afternoon, Mrs.
Blount," he broke out hastily, "but I can tell you
this much: I am my father's son now, whatever I
have been in the past, and if he is in danger, my
place is with him. Tell me where he has gone."</p>

<p>The little lady's eyes were demurely downcast.
"I shouldn't dare tell you that, but&#8212;but perhaps I
might show you. I didn't promise not to&#8212;not to
follow him," she returned with exactly the proper
shade of half-frightened reluctance.</p>

<p>"Is it far?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Y-yes; we should have to drive."</p>

<p>"Excuse me for a minute or two," he said abruptly,
and, making a bolt for the elevator, he was back almost
within the limit named with a top-coat for
himself and a driving-wrap for his companion. "I
broke into your suite and made Patricia give me
the wrap," he explained. "If it isn't what you
want, I'll try again."</p>

<p>"It will do nicely," she told him; and together they
went down the broad marble stair to the ground-floor.</p>

<p>"Do we take a cab?" he asked, when they reached
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"No; it's only a short walk to the garage, and we
can take the touring-car."</p>

<p>"I'm entirely in your hands," he rejoined; and
then: "Perhaps you'd better take my arm. We
can make quicker time that way."</p>

<p>The small plotter's eyes were dancing when she
slipped her hand under his arm. In a career which
had not been entirely devoid of excitement, Mrs.
Honoria had rarely found men difficult. But this
particular young man was proving himself to be the
easiest among many.</p>

<p>At the garage Blount asked for the family touring-car,
more than half-expecting to be told that his
father had taken it. The garage man nodded and
laughed. "You can have it, but you came within an
ace of losing out," he said. "The senator was just
here, and he was going to take it, but he changed
his mind when I told him the big roadster was in."</p>

<p>Blount made no comment, and when the car was
ready he asked his companion where she would ride.</p>

<p>"In front, with you," was the quick reply; and
when they were placed she gave him his running
orders. "Slip out of the city by the quietest streets
you can find and take the Quaretaro road," she directed,
and he obeyed in silence, holding the speed
down until they had left the capital behind them
and were bowling along under the stars on the fine
boulevarded county road.</p>

<p>"Do we take it easy or the other way?" he asked,
speaking for the first time since they had left the
town garage.</p>

<p>"You may drive as fast as you like until we come
to the hills," he was told; and with this permission
Blount let the motor out and speedily put the fifteen
miles of the straightaway road to the rear.</p>

<p>"Is it Wartrace?" he inquired, when the touring-car
was breasting the first of the grades in the gulch-threading
climb to the second mesa level.</p>

<p>"No. When you come to the pine-tree, turn to
the right up Shonoho Canyon."</p>

<p>"We can't get anywhere on that road," he objected.
"It's washed out and posted. I tried to go
up there the other day when I had Patricia out in
the little car."</p>

<p>"I think you will find it quite passable to-night,"
was all the answer he got; and a little later, when
they had turned out of the main road and were
ascending the small canyon, the prophecy came
true. The brush barricade had been thrown aside,
and there were fresh wheel tracks in the sand.</p>

<p>At sight of the wheel marks the senator's wife
spoke again.</p>

<p>"You have been up here before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once; in the middle of the summer."</p>

<p>"There is a small hotel at the head of the road."</p>

<p>"I know; but it is closed."</p>

<p>"It has been reopened&#8212;please throttle the motor
so it won't make so much noise&#8212;the hotel is occupied
now, as I say, and that is where we shall find
your father. Are you still willing to do as I tell
you to?"</p>

<p>"In all things reasonable."</p>

<p>"As if I'd ask you to do anything unreasonable!"
she broke out half-petulantly. "Listen; there is a
lawn with a circular driveway in front of the hotel.
Drive to the outer edge, near the cliff, and stop the
car."</p>

<p>Five minutes later he had obeyed his instructions
literally. Through the groving of trees on the lawn
he could see the lights in the lower story of the inn.
At the flicking of the motor-switch a man with a
pair of lineman's climbing spurs at his belt rose up
out of the shadows and touched his cap to the lady,
saying: "The boss is here; he has just gone in."</p>

<p>"I know," was the low-toned response. And then
to Evan: "Help me out, please."</p>

<p>When they stood together beside the car she
spoke again to the lineman.</p>

<p>"Is it all right, Jackson? Can you do what I
asked you to?"</p>

<p>"We can try it a whirl," said the man; and thereupon
he led the way across the lawn, around to the
darkened end of the bungalow-built resort house,
and through a sheltering pergola to a side door. "I
got hold of the key, and it's open," he signified,
meaning the door. "Can you find your way in the
dark on the inside?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," was the whispered reply; and then
the lineman guide got his further orders: "Go back
to the car and see that nobody interferes with it,
Jackson." Then, when the man had disappeared in
the tree shadows, the little lady turned short upon
Blount. "I am going to take you where you can
see and hear, but you must promise me not to interfere
unless it becomes perfectly plain that your
father needs you. Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"It is&#8212;if you'll allow me to be the judge of the
need."</p>

<p>She laughed softly. "You are simply incorrigible,
and I should think there would be times when Patricia
would be tempted to stick pins into you," she
mocked. Then: "Come on; we are wasting time,"
and, entering the house, she took his hand and led
him through a dark passage, up a stair, through
another passage into a long, low-pitched room, bare
and empty save for a great pyramid of dining-tables
and chairs piled in the middle of it, and lastly through
a cautiously opened door which admitted a flood of
yellow lamp-light from below.</p>

<p>"The musicians' gallery," she whispered. "Go
to the screen and look down, but for Heaven's sake,
don't make any noise!"</p>

<p>Blount obeyed mechanically. The orchestra gallery,
screened on three sides by an open fretwork of
Moorish design, was built out from the wall of the
dining-room, and through the latticings of the fretwork
he could look down upon the oblong lobby of
the resort hotel. There was a table-desk with lamps
on it drawn out in front of a cheerful wood-fire
burning in a great stone fireplace, and in front of
the fire, standing with his back to the blaze, Blount
saw his father. From a lighted room at the opposite
end of the lobby space came a confused clattering
of telegraph instruments. Blount caught a glimpse
of shirt-sleeved clerks moving about in the room
beyond, and then a door opened beneath him and
the vice-president of the Transcontinental Company
strode out into the firelight to shake hands with his
visitor and to say: "I've been looking for you; I
thought you'd come in out of the wet before it was
too late, David. Sit down and tell me how much
you're going to bleed us for, and I'll make out the
check."</p>

<p>With a cold hand gripping at his heart, Blount
turned away, sick and revolted, and there was a
curse on his lips for the cruelty of the woman who
had brought him to be a witness to his father's
shame. But when he groped for the door of egress
and found it, the knob refused to turn. The door
was locked and he could not retreat.</p>

<h3>THE RECKONING</h3>


<p>Evan Blount's first impulse when he found his
retreat cut off by the locked door of the musicians'
gallery was to make his presence known instantly
to the two men standing before the fire in the lobby
below. Shame, vicarious shame for the father who
would thus find himself unmasked before his son,
was all that made him hesitate; and in the pausing
moment he heard his father's reply to the vice-president's
challenging greeting.</p>

<p>"The same old song; always the same old song
with you, isn't it, Hardwick?" the senator was saying
in jocose deprecation. "What money can't
buy, isn't worth having; that's about the way you
fellows always stack it up." Then, with sudden
grimness: "Sit down, Hardwick. I've come to say
a few things to you that won't listen very good, but
you've got to take your medicine this time."</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded the vice-president,
dropping mechanically into his desk-chair. And then:
"It's no use, David. We've beat you at your own
game. We're going to roll up a majority next Tuesday
that will wipe you and your broken-down machine
out of existence. Don't you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Not yet&#8212;not quite yet" was the mild rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better believe it, because it's the
truth. You are down and out. I had you beat,
David, that night last summer when you gave me
your 'de-fi' and I came back by taking your son
away from you. The young gentleman you were
going to spring on us for your next attorney-general
has done more than any other one man in the campaign
to help our lame dog over the stile."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the big man, sunning his back at the
fire, "that is one of the things we're going to flail
out right here and now, Hardwick; about the boy
and what he's been doing. You told him to go out
and preach the good, clean gospel of the square deal,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>It was at this point that the listener in the musicians'
gallery, a prey to tumultuous emotions which
were making the freshly healing wound in his head
throb like a trip-hammer, lost all of his compunctions
and drew closer to the fretwork screen.</p>

<p>"He didn't need any special instructions," was
the vice-president's rejoinder, and his tone chimed
in with the hard-bitted smile. "Now that it is all
over, I don't mind telling you that he mapped the
thing out for himself, and all we had to do was to
sit tight and give him plenty of rope. Candidly,
David, I don't believe I'm hardened enough to play
the game as it ought to be played out here in the
sage-brush hills. The young fellow's sincerity came
pretty near getting away with me when I saw how
ridiculously in earnest he was."</p>

<p>"Yet you let him go on, putting himself deeper
and deeper in the hole every time he stood up before
an audience, and you never said a word&#8212;never gave
him a hint that you were not going to back him up
in everything he was saying?"</p>

<p>This time the hard-bitted smile broke into a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Let's get down to business, David. You wouldn't
expect us to throw the game away when somebody
was trying his best to put the winning card into our
hands. We needn't dig back into the campaign for
something to jangle over, you and I. We can come
right down to the present moment. You're cornered,
but I don't deny that you've still got a few votes to
dispose of. How much do you want for them?"</p>

<p>Blount saw his father take a step forward, and
for a flitting instant he thought there would be violence.
But apparently nothing was farther from the
senator's intention.</p>

<p>"I'm not selling to-night, Hardwick; I'm buying,"
he said, with the good-natured smile wrinkling at
the corners of his eyes. "I want to know how much
you'll take to clean up right where you are and
make my boy's word good to the people of this
State."</p>

<p>Mr. McVickar turned to his table-desk and took
up a sheaf of telegrams.</p>

<p>"I'm a pretty busy man this evening, David; and
if you haven't anything better than that to offer&#8212;"</p>

<p>"You've got a lot of crooked deals out&#8212;special
rates and rebates and such things; the boy believed
you were going to call them all off and be good,
Hardwick."</p>

<p>The vice-president laid the telegrams aside and
turned back again with the air of a man determined
to sweep away all the obstructions at one shrewd
push.</p>

<p>"You're wasting your time and mine; let's get
down to business," he snapped. "Some little time
ago your son began to urge this same 'reform measure,'
as he termed it. I believe he even went so
far as to threaten Gantry and Kittredge with the
publication of certain private letters from our patrons,
letters written to him in his capacity of field
campaigner for our company. I don't suppose he
really meant to do any such disloyal thing as that,
but&#8212;"</p>

<p>"But to make sure he wouldn't, you had one of
your hired shadow-men blow up his safe and steal
the letters," put in the senator mildly. "That was
prudent, Hardwick. I was a little scared up myself
for fear Evan might get real good and mad, and let
the cat out of the bag; I was, for a fact."</p>

<p>"Without admitting the safe-blowing, I may say
that the letters were destroyed, and our friends were
advised to be a little more conservative in their correspondence.
That settles the 'reform measure' incident
and brings us down to the present argument.
If you are not here to get in line with us, what did
you come for?"</p>

<p>"I came to give you one more chance to be decent,
Hardwick; just&#8212;one&#8212;more&#8212;last&#8212;chance."</p>

<p>"David, there are times when you make me tired,
and this is one of them. For years you've held us
up and dictated to us; but this time we've got you
by the neck. Did you ever happen to hear of a fellow
named Thomas Gryson?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I've heard of him. I believe he has
been on your pay-rolls for a while&#8212;notwithstanding
the fact that he is an escaped criminal," was the
shrewd counter-thrust.</p>

<p>"He's a scoundrel; we'll admit that. Just the
same, your son hired him to go out and get evidence
in a certain matter of alleged crookedness in the
registration lists. He got it, and delivered the papers
to your son last night. Some of those affidavits incriminate
you, David. If we wanted to use them,
we could send you to the penitentiary, right here in
your own State."</p>

<p>The senator drew up a mock-Sheraton arm-chair
and lowered his huge frame gently into it.</p>

<p>"In order to use those papers against me you'd
first have to get hold of them, wouldn't you, Hardwick?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We have them," was the terse assertion.</p>

<p>The Honorable David's chuckle rumbled deep in
his capacious chest.</p>

<p>"Barto phoned you an hour or so ago that he
had 'em, but, owing to circumstances over which he
had no control, he couldn't deliver 'em to you until
to-morrow morning. Isn't that about the way it
shapes up?"</p>

<p>The vice-president's frown marked an added degree
of irritation. "So you have a cut-in on my
telephone wire, have you?" he rasped.</p>

<p>The senator leaned forward and laid a forefinger
on the vice-presidential knee.</p>

<p>"Listen, Hardwick," he said. "I dictated that
phone message to you, and Barto repeated it word
for word because he had to&#8212;I reckon maybe it was
because one of my men was holding a gun to his
other ear while he talked to you. The little hold-up
that you planned this afternoon didn't come off.
Barto lost out bad, and when we get around to
giving him the third degree, I shouldn't wonder if
he'd tell a whole lot of things that you wouldn't
want to see printed in the newspapers."</p>

<p>Mr. McVickar sprang out of his chair with an
agility surprising in so heavy a man, crossed to the
open door of the room where his clerical force was
at work, and slammed it shut. When he returned,
he was no longer the confident tyrant of foregone
conclusions.</p>

<p>"Where are those papers now, Blount?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"They are in the hands of Chief Justice Hemingway,
for investigation and such action as he and his
colleagues on the Supreme Court bench see fit to
take."</p>

<p>"Good God! Your son did that, knowing that you
are as deep in the mud as we are in the mire?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he did, so. That boy is all wool and a
yard wide. He thought he was putting me in the
hole, too, along with Kittredge and your railroad
crooks, and it came mighty near tearing him in two.
But he did it. You haven't been more than half-appreciating
that boy, Hardwick."</p>

<p>"'He thought,' you say; isn't it the fact that you
are in the hole, David?"</p>

<p>The senator reached over, took one of the gigantic
McVickar cigars from the open box on the desk, and
calmly lighted it.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty hard man to convince, Hardwick,"
he said slowly, when the big cigar was filling
the air of the lobby with its fragrance. "Away along
back at the beginning of this fight I told you what
I was aiming to do, and why. You wouldn't believe
it then, and you don't want to believe it now; but
that's because you don't happen to have a son of
your own. When that boy of mine wired me that
he was coming out here to get into the harness, I
began to turn over the leaves of the record and look
back a little. It was a mighty dirty record, McVickar.
I don't know that I'm any better man
now than I was in the days when we made that
record&#8212;you and I&#8212;but when I looked it over, it
struck me all in a heap that I'd have to get out the
bucket and scrubbing-brush if I didn't want to make
a clean-hearted, clean-minded boy plumb ashamed
of his old daddy."</p>

<p>"But, say&#8212;you haven't quit your scheming for a
single minute, Blount!" retorted the railroad tyrant.
"You are just as much the boss of the machine to-day
as you've ever been!"</p>

<p>"I reckon, that's so, too," was the measured reply.
"But there's just this one little difference,
Hardwick: a machine, in a factory or in politics,
is a mighty necessary thing, and we wouldn't get
very far nowadays without it. Here in America
we're just coming to learn that machine politics&#8212;which
is sometimes only another name for intelligent
organization&#8212;needn't be bad politics unless we
make 'em bad. To put it another way, the machine
will grind corn or clean up the streets and alleys
just as easily as it will grind up men and principles."</p>

<p>The vice-president made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Come to the point," he urged. "Do you mean
to tell me that you can face an investigation by the
Supreme Court?"</p>

<p>"For this one time, Hardwick, I can. For this
one time in the history of the Sage-Brush State, the
slate&#8212;the machine slate&#8212;is as clean as the back of
your hand. When the court comes to investigate,
it will find that every crooked deal in this campaign
has had a railroad man or a corporation man at the
back of it. Let me tell you what's due to happen.
Chief Justice Hemingway had luncheon with me to-day,
and he came early enough to give me a quiet
hour before we went to table with the ladies. There
is going to be an investigation, and some sharp,
shrewd young lawyer is going to be appointed by
the court to take evidence. When this young man
gets to work, every wheel in the machine is going
to roll his way. Every bribe you've offered and
paid, every false name you've put on the registration
lists, every deal you've made with men like
Pete Hathaway and McDarragh, has had its witnesses,
and by the gods, Hardwick, they'll testify&#8212;every
man of them!"</p>

<p>Again the vice-president sprang from his chair,
but this time it was to walk the floor with his head
bowed and his hands in his pockets. The listener
in the musicians' gallery found a seat and sat down to
let the intoxicating, overwhelming joy of it all have
its will of him. In the fulness of time the tramping
magnate who had been so crushingly out-generalled
in his own chosen field came to stand before the big
man, who was still quietly smoking in the sham-Sheraton
arm-chair.</p>

<p>"You spoke of the appointment of a special prosecuting
attorney, David," he said in a harsh monotone.
"Who will it be?"</p>

<p>"You've guessed it already, I reckon. It'll be
the boy, Hardwick. Hemingway will appoint him
if he is willing to serve."</p>

<p>"He's taken our retainer!" snapped the vice-president.</p>

<p>"Not much, he hasn't! you hired him for wages,
and if he wants to resign&#8212;he has resigned, by the way&#8212;and
take another job, I reckon he can do it without
breaking any of the Ten Commandments."</p>

<p>"We can't stand for that&#8212;you know we can't."</p>

<p>"No; I don't think you can&#8212;not as a corporation.
Besides the flock of witnesses that we can
drum up, he'll have those letters that we were talking
about a while back. You missed fire on that, too,
Hardwick. What your man dynamited out of Evan's
office safe, and what you destroyed, were only clever
copies. The real letters were stolen by the boy's
friends, and little as you may believe it, the object of
that theft was to give you this last chance. The boy
was mighty hot under the collar, and we couldn't be
sure that he wouldn't start the fireworks before the
band was ready to play. He would have started
them, too, if his match hadn't been taken away from
him."</p>

<p>Mr. McVickar walked around the other end of the
table-desk and sat down heavily.</p>

<p>"You've spoken twice of a 'last chance' David,"
he said grittingly. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's the chance I gave you in the beginning.
First, let me tell you what I reckon you're already
admitting. You're whipped, Hardwick; your slate's
broken, and your man Reynolds hasn't a ghost of a
show&#8212;he nor any of the others on your string. You
haven't made a move that we haven't caught onto
just about as soon as you put your fingers on the
piece you meant to move. For instance, that little
box up there in the beaming just over your head&#8212;the
one that looks as if it were a part of the house
electric installation&#8212;is a microphone, and one of
your own men helped to put it up. We've got
copies of every letter and telegram you've dictated
since you had this desk dragged out here a week ago
Saturday."</p>

<p>"I'm taking all that for granted," was the curt
admission.</p>

<p>"Then we'll come down to the nib of the thing
and put you out of your misery. You've got two
things to do&#8212;just two, Hardwick. One of 'em is
to clean house and make a good job of it, just like
you let Evan believe you were going to do when you
sent him out to tell the people of this State a lot of
things that you didn't mean to have come true; cut
out all the deals, all the private tariffs, all the little
preferentials and palm-warmings. When you've
done that, you'll find that the other thing will
mighty nearly do itself."</p>

<p>"Name it," rasped the magnate.</p>

<p>"It's just merely to take your railroad out of
politics in this State, and keep it out. We've had
enough of you, McVickar, and more than enough.
Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"It's a damned one-sided bargain thus far, Blount.
What do we get for all this?"</p>

<p>Again the senator chuckled genially. "You may
not believe it, but we're going to let you down easy.
You do these two things that I've mentioned, and
get rid of Kittredge and a few others that have been
caught red-handed, and the Supreme Court investigation
won't touch your railroad as a corporation&#8212;in
other words, it'll go after individuals. But
you've got to play fair, you know&#8212;and bring forth
fruits meet for repentance, before the fact. How
does that strike you?"</p>

<p>Again the vice-president got up to walk the floor,
but this time the deliberative interval was shorter.</p>

<p>"What is the political programme, as you have it
figured out, David?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"It'll be a landslide for us, as I have told you.
Gordon will go in by the biggest majority that has
ever been rolled up in this State. Dortscher will
succeed himself as attorney-general; and by and by,
after things have quieted down, he will resign. That
will give Gordon the appointment of his successor,
and I'm thinking it might be a pretty good thing
for you, as well as for the people of the State, if
Alec should happen to pick out a bright young fellow
who knows your side of the question as well as
the people's, and who is square enough to give you
a fair show when it comes to framing up any new
railroad legislation."</p>

<p>"That will be your son, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"If he'll take it," was the imperturbable rejoinder.</p>

<p>For the third time the vice-president, dying hard,
as befitted him, deliberated thoughtfully. At the
end of the thoughtful interval he took a cigar from
the open box and clamped it between his teeth.</p>

<p>"We trade," he said shortly. And then: "How
will you take it&#8212;in stock or bonds?"</p>

<p>The Honorable David rose slowly and snapped
the cigar ash into the fire.</p>

<p>"I'm right sorry, Hardwick, but this is one time
when I reckon we'll have to have what you might
call the spot cash. Promises don't go. You're too
good a fighter to be allowed to get up merely because
you've hollered 'enough.' Come on into your
telegraph-shop and let me hear you dictate that
string of 'come-off' orders. Then we'll drive to
town in my road-car, and you can tip off Kittredge
and a few of the other prominent victims by word of
mouth, as you'll most likely want to."</p>

<p>For a full minute after the two had left the lobby
together Evan Blount sat motionless in the screened
orchestra gallery. Then he got up and groped once
more for the door-knob. It yielded at his touch, and
in the semi-darkness beyond the opening he saw his
father's wife with her arms upstretched to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Evan, dear&#8212;am I forgiven?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>"Little mother!" he said, and then he took her
face between his hands and kissed her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When the Honorable David Blount reached the
city an hour or more later, and had dropped his passenger
at the Railway Club, he found his son waiting
for him in the otherwise deserted sitting-room
of the Inter-Mountain private suite.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep without telling you first, dad,"
the waiting one broke out. "I've been eavesdropping;
I was a listener, unwilling at first, but not
afterward, to everything that was said an hour or
so ago in the lobby of the little hotel at the head of
Shonoho. Do I need to tell you in so many words
how deep the plough has gone?"</p>

<p>"I reckon not," was the gentle reply. "Neither
do you need to tell me how you came to be out at
Shonoho when I thought I'd left you tied hand and
foot right here in the hotel." Then, with the quizzical
smile wrinkling at the corners of the grave
eyes: "How does the political wrestle strike you by
this time, son?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me that I haven't been in it; not even
in the outer edges of it. Isn't that about the size
of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; you've been doing good work, mighty
good work. You've helped out in the only way
that help could come in this campaign; you've
stirred up a good, healthy public sentiment in favor
of a square deal for everybody. McVickar was fixing
to tangle it all up&#8212;get the people down on him
until they'd simply legislate the life out of his railroad.
But he couldn't see that."</p>

<p>"He sees it now&#8212;the 'machine' has made him
see it."</p>

<p>"Yes. You didn't know that a machine could be
put to any really righteous use, did you, boy? But
in this campaign it has gone in to knock out the
crookedness, big <i>and</i> little. Listen, son; you heard
what I told McVickar. After you'd sent me that
wire from Boston last summer, saying you'd come,
I lay awake nights projecting how I'd put you in
training for a spell, and then help you into the saddle
and make you the boss of the round-up, the same
as I'd been. Then it came over me, all of a sudden,
that I'd been as crooked as a dog's hind leg&#8212;that
we'd all been crooked. Not that I've ever taken a
dollar for my personal pocket, for I haven't; but I've
bought and sold and dickered and schemed with
the best of 'em, and the worst of 'em. On top of
that, I began to ask myself how I'd like it to see
you wallowing in the same old mud-hole, and&#8212;well,
Evan, boy, you may have a son of your own some
day, and then you'll know. I let things rock along
until you came; until that first day at Wartrace
when you ripped out at me about hewing to the
line. Right then and there I made up my mind
that I'd put the whole power of the 'machine,' as
you call it, into one campaign for a clean election
and a square deal."</p>

<p>"Oh, good Lord!" ejaculated the son, "and I've
been fighting you and your organization at every
turn!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you haven't," was the quick rejoinder.</p>

<p>"You've been fighting graft and crookedness, and
that's what you thought you were hired to do. As
you know now, McVickar wasn't playing quite fair
with you. Just the same, you've been in the hands
of your friends, right from the start. It's the organization
that's been giving you all these chances
to preach the gospel of the square deal; it was a
shrewd little captain-general of the organization
who pushed Hathaway up against you to let you
know that the railroad people were running around
in the same old circles&#8212;hollering for justice, and
doing everything under the sun to defeat the ends
of justice&#8212;muddying the spring because, they say,
they don't know what else to do. And, by the way,
it was that same little captain-general who put you
up against the real thing to-night, without telling
me or anybody else what she was going to do."</p>

<p>The younger man left his chair to go to one of the
windows where he stood for a moment or two looking
down upon the street-lights. When he turned,
it was to say: "I'm with you, dad, heart and soul.
But you won't mind my saying that I'm still a little
bit afraid that you and your kind are a menace to
civilization and a free government. You'll let me
hang on to that much of my prejudice, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Hang on to anything you like, son, and
say anything you like. Or, rather, let me say something
first. How about this 'career' business of
Patricia's? Have you fixed that up yet?"</p>

<p>Blount shook his head. "She's going home with
her father next week," he said. And then: "Do
you know what she did to-day, dad? She ran the
little red car into that pine-tree intentionally&#8212;so
I couldn't get back here in time to give Judge Hemingway
those affidavits, which we both supposed
would incriminate you."</p>

<p>"Well, God bless her loyal little soul!" exclaimed
the Honorable David, and the grave eyes were suspiciously
bright. "I hadn't told her a word of what
I was trying to do; but, Lord love you, Evan, she
knew: you trust a good woman for knowing, every
time, son. And now one more thing: Have you
come to know Honoria any better in these last few
days?"</p>

<p>"Yes; much better, within the last few hours,
dad."</p>

<p>"That's good; that does my old heart a heap of
good, son! Now then, you go straight off to bed
and sleep up some. You've had a mighty hard day
for a sick man. To-morrow morning we'll drive out
to Wartrace and get ready to touch off the fireworks
when the returns trickle in on Tuesday. I tell you,
boy, Tuesday's election is going to be a regular old-fashioned,
heave-'em-up and keep-'em-a-going land-slide!
Good-night, and good dreams&#8212;if that cracked

<h3><i>À LA BONNE HEURE</i></h3>


<p>By some law of contraries, whose workings not
even the politically profound can fathom, the election
proved the truth of the adage that all signs
fail in a dry time by recording itself as one of the
quietest and most orderly ever known in the Sage-Brush
State. A few editors there were, like Blenkinsop,
of <i>The Plainsman</i>, who maintained stoutly
that it sounded the death-knell of the machine,
but there was no gainsaying the result. The "Paramounters"
ticket, with or without the help of the
machine, was elected by sweeping majorities everywhere;
and Gantry, roaming the corridors and lounging-rooms
of the Railway Club and reading the
bulletins as they were posted, shook his head despairingly
over each fresh announcement.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, finding that the senator's
party had left the Inter-Mountain the day before to
drive to Wartrace, the traffic manager called up the
Quaretaro Mesa country-house and poured the news
of the <i>débâcle</i> into Evan Blount's ear.</p>

<p>"We've gone to the everlasting bow-wows, and
Mr. McVickar has disappeared, and the end of the
world has come," was the way he phrased it for the
listening ear; but the word which came back must
have been peculiarly heartening, since from that time
on to an hour well past midnight Gantry figured
hilariously as the self-constituted host of any and all
who would be entertained.</p>

<p>At Wartrace Hall there was also rejoicing, albeit
of a quieter sort. Five people sat around the cheerful
blaze in the library, and when Crowell, whose
telegraph instrument was in the adjoining den, had
brought the final report from the outlying wards of
the capital, he was told to close his key and go to
bed.</p>

<p>After the young man had withdrawn, the Honorable
David rose to stand with his back to the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, Evan, boy, are all the tangles straightened
out for you for keeps, now?" he asked jovially.</p>

<p>"Just about all of them, dad," laughed the younger
man. He had been spending a very happy evening,
due less to the triumphant story which had been
pouring in over the wires than to the fact that Patricia
had been occupying the other half of the small
sofa which he had dragged out to face the fire.</p>

<p>"Don't feel sore because you didn't get the
governor you thought you were going to get when
you went around preaching the gospel?" said the
father, still chuckling.</p>

<p>"We've got a better man and a bigger one, I'm
sure," was the quick reply. Then he added: "But
I think I am still doubtful about the advisability of
injecting the machine principle into politics."</p>

<p>The senator laughed silently.</p>

<p>"Call it 'the organization' instead of 'the machine,'
son, and you've named the power that moves
the civilized world to-day. Man, the individual, is
just about as helpless as a new-born baby. If you
want to reform anything, from an unjust poor-law
to the tariff, your first move is to rustle up a following;
after that, you've got to solidify your bunch
of sympathizers into a working organization&#8212;in
other words, into a machine. Isn't that so, Professor
Anners?"</p>

<p>The white-haired professor of palæontology nodded
sleepily. He had been dreaming of the Megalosauridæ,
and had not heard the question.</p>

<p>"You've heard me called 'the boss' from the time
Dick Gantry had his first talk with you back yonder
in Massachusetts," the senator went on, turning again
to his son. "Call me a man with friends enough to
make me a sort of foreman of round-ups in the old
home State, and you've got it about right. I don't
say that I've always used the power as it ought to
be used; the good Lord knows, I'm no more infallible
than other folks. You've gone through a heap of
trouble and worry because you thought, when you
got ready to knock the wedge out of the log, my
fingers were going to get caught in the split, along
with a lot of others. That would have been true
enough any other year but this, I reckon, so you
didn't have your fight and your worry for nothing.
I've bought and trafficked and bargained and compromised&#8212;I
don't deny that&#8212;but only when it
seemed as though the end justified the means.
Maybe the end never does justify the means&#8212;I'm
open to conviction on that. But sometimes it's
mighty easy to persuade yourself that it does."</p>

<p>It was just here that the professor awoke with a
start and a snort, excused himself abruptly, and
stumped off to bed. Mrs. Honoria, sitting under the
drop-light and stitching patiently at her bit of
stretched linen, laid the tiny embroidery-hoop aside,
signalled to her husband, and vanished in her turn.
A few minutes after she had gone, the senator
crossed from his corner of the fireplace to stand
before the two sitting on the little sofa.</p>

<p>"Son," he said gravely, "you've got your work
cut out for you from this on, and it's a good-sized
job. You're going to have a string of hard fights,
one after the other, and there'll be times when you'll
long with all your soul for some good, clean-hearted,
bright-minded little girl to go to for comfort and
counsel. Of course, I know that Patricia, here, has
another job, but&#8212;"</p>

<p>The Honorable Senator Sage-Brush had been out
of sight and hearing for five full minutes when Evan
Blount reached over and possessed himself of the
hand that was shading a pair of deep-welled eyes
from the firelight.</p>

<p>"Last Sunday afternoon, Patricia, when I had
right and reason and logic on my side, your woman's
intuition found the truer path," he said, in sober
humility. "I know I am only one, and your poor
people to whom you have been planning to give
yourself are many; still, I am selfish enough to&#8212;"</p>

<p>She looked up quickly and the deep-welled eyes
were shining.</p>

<p>"We can't learn everything all at once, Evan,
dear," she interrupted, breaking in upon his pleading.
"There was one moment in that Sunday afternoon
when I learned the greatest thing of all; it
was the moment when I saw the pine-tree lying
across the road and knew what I should do, and for
whom I should do it."</p>

<p>"I know," he returned gently. "You learned
that love is stronger than death or the fear of death;
and that loyalty is greater than many ideals. You
heard what my father said just now, and it is true&#8212;only
he didn't put it half vitally enough; I can't
walk in the way he has marked out for me without
you, Patricia."</p>

<p>With a swift little love impulse she lifted his hand
and pressed it to her cheek.</p>

<p>"You needn't, Evan, dear," she said simply.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
